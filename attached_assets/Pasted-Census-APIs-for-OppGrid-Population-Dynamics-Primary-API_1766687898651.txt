Census APIs for OppGrid Population Dynamics
Primary APIs (Must Have)
1. Population Estimates API ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
URL: https://api.census.gov/data/2024/pep/population
What it provides:

Current population counts (updated annually)
Year-over-year change
Components of change (births, deaths, migration)

Key Variables:
javascript// Annual population estimates
POP         // Total population
DENSITY     // Population density
BIRTHS      // Number of births
DEATHS      // Number of deaths
NATURALINC  // Natural increase (births - deaths)
DOMESTICMIG // Net domestic migration
INTERNATIONALMIG // Net international migration
NETMIG      // Total net migration

// Available geographies: Nation, State, County, Metro/Micro Areas
Example Call:
javascript// Get all counties with population and migration data
const response = await axios.get(
  'https://api.census.gov/data/2024/pep/population',
  {
    params: {
      get: 'POP,BIRTHS,DEATHS,DOMESTICMIG,INTERNATIONALMIG,NETMIG,NAME',
      for: 'county:*',
      key: YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY
    }
  }
);

// Returns data like:
// ["POP","BIRTHS","DEATHS","DOMESTICMIG","INTERNATIONALMIG","NETMIG","NAME","state","county"]
// ["524893","5432","3876","2341","567","2908","Austin County, Texas","48","015"]

2. ACS Migration Flows ⭐ FOR MIGRATION PATTERNS
URL: https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/flows
What it provides:

County-to-county migration
Metro-to-metro migration
Demographics of movers (age, income, education)

Key Variables:
javascriptMOVEDIN     // Number of people who moved in
MOVEDOUT    // Number of people who moved out
MOVEDNET    // Net migration (in - out)
GEOID1      // Origin geography ID
FULL1_NAME  // Origin geography name
GEOID2      // Destination geography ID
FULL2_NAME  // Destination geography name

// Demographic breakdowns (when available):
AGE1        // Movers age 1-17
AGE2        // Movers age 18-34
AGE3        // Movers age 35-64
AGE4        // Movers age 65+
INCOME      // Median income of movers
Example Call:
javascript// Get migration flows INTO Austin County, TX
const response = await axios.get(
  'https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/flows',
  {
    params: {
      get: 'MOVEDIN,MOVEDOUT,MOVEDNET,GEOID1,FULL1_NAME,GEOID2,FULL2_NAME',
      for: 'county:015',  // Austin County
      in: 'state:48',     // Texas
      key: YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY
    }
  }
);

// Returns where people are moving FROM into Austin County

3. ACS 5-Year Data (You already have this)
URL: https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5
This is what you're already using for demographics. Just confirming you have it.

Secondary APIs (Nice to Have)
4. Decennial Census - For 10-year comparisons
URL: https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl
Use case: Compare 2020 vs 2010 for long-term growth trends
javascript// Get 2020 population
const response2020 = await axios.get(
  'https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl',
  {
    params: {
      get: 'P1_001N,NAME',  // Total population
      for: 'county:*',
      key: YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY
    }
  }
);

// Get 2010 population
const response2010 = await axios.get(
  'https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1',
  {
    params: {
      get: 'P001001,NAME',  // Total population
      for: 'county:*',
      key: YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY
    }
  }
);

// Calculate 10-year CAGR

Recommended Data Collection Strategy
Phase 1: Population Growth (Week 1)
Use Population Estimates API to get:

2019-2024 annual population for all counties
Migration components for each year

javascript// Import script - run once, then monthly updates
async function importPopulationData() {
  for (let year = 2019; year <= 2024; year++) {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://api.census.gov/data/${year}/pep/population`,
      {
        params: {
          get: 'POP,BIRTHS,DEATHS,DOMESTICMIG,INTERNATIONALMIG,NETMIG,NAME',
          for: 'county:*',
          key: CENSUS_API_KEY
        }
      }
    );
    
    // Store in your database
    await storePopulationData(response.data, year);
  }
}
Phase 2: Migration Flows (Week 2)
Use ACS Migration Flows to get:

County-to-county movement patterns
Top origins for each destination

javascriptasync function importMigrationFlows() {
  // Get all counties first
  const counties = await getCountiesFromDB();
  
  for (const county of counties) {
    const response = await axios.get(
      'https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/flows',
      {
        params: {
          get: 'MOVEDIN,GEOID1,FULL1_NAME,GEOID2,FULL2_NAME',
          for: `county:${county.code}`,
          in: `state:${county.state}`,
          key: CENSUS_API_KEY
        }
      }
    );
    
    // Store top 20 origins for each county
    await storeMigrationFlows(response.data, county);
  }
}

Quick Reference: Which API for What
NeedAPIEndpointCurrent populationPopulation Estimates/data/2024/pep/populationYear-over-year growthPopulation Estimates/data/{year}/pep/populationMigration (where from/to)ACS Flows/data/2023/acs/flowsDemographics (age, income)ACS 5-Year/data/2023/acs/acs510-year comparisonDecennial/data/2020/dec/pl

Geographic Levels Available
Each API supports different geography levels:
Population Estimates:

✅ Nation
✅ State
✅ County
✅ Metro/Micro Areas
✅ Place (cities)
❌ Census Tract (not available)

ACS Flows:

✅ County-to-county
✅ Metro-to-metro
❌ Tract-level (not available)

ACS 5-Year:

✅ Nation to Census Tract (all levels)

For tract-level growth: You'll need to calculate it from ACS 5-Year data by comparing 2019 vs 2023 estimates, not from Population Estimates API.

Final Recommendation
Start with these 2 APIs:

Population Estimates API (/data/2024/pep/population)

Import for years 2019-2024
Get county-level population and migration
Updates annually (released in March)


ACS Migration Flows (/data/2023/acs/flows)

Import county-to-county flows
Get top 20 origins for each destination
Updates annually with ACS data



You already have ACS 5-Year, which gives you the demographic details (income, age, education) for each geography.
Together these 3 APIs give you everything:

Current population (Pop Estimates)
Growth rates (Pop Estimates historical)
Where people are moving from (Migration Flows)
Who is moving (ACS 5-Year demographics)
