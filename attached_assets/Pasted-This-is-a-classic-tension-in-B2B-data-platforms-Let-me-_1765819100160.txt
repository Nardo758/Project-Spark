This is a classic tension in B2B data platforms. Let me break down a multi-layered strategy that balances discovery, value delivery, and data protection:
Core Strategy: Progressive Value Disclosure
Tier 1: Free Discovery (Hook)

Show opportunity title + high-level category
Display engagement metrics (Reddit upvotes, comment count)
Show geographic tags and trend indicator
Basic one-sentence description
"Unlock full analysis" CTA

Tier 2: Pro Research ($99/month)

Full problem description with quotes
Basic validation signals (source links, comment sentiment)
Consumer pain point analysis
Market size indicators
Geographic applicability breakdown
Critical limit: 50 detailed views/month (prevents bulk extraction)

Tier 3: Business Deep Dive ($499/month)

Everything in Pro, plus:
Competitive landscape analysis
AI-generated business model suggestions
Related opportunity clusters
Historical trend data
Limit: 200 detailed views/month
Export to PDF (watermarked with user email + timestamp)

Tier 4: Enterprise (Custom)

API access with rate limiting
Bulk data access (filtered by category/geography)
Custom alerts and monitoring
Dedicated support

Technical Protection Mechanisms
Rate Limiting by Action Type
Free users:
- 10 opportunity previews/day
- 0 full views

Pro users:
- Unlimited previews
- 50 full detailed views/month
- 5 AI report generations/month

Business users:
- Unlimited previews
- 200 full views/month
- 25 AI reports/month
View Tracking Architecture

Track every "full view" action per user
Reset monthly counters on billing cycle
Show remaining quota in UI prominently
Soft paywall: "You've used 45/50 views this month"

Anti-Scraping Measures

Session-based tokens - Each full view requires a unique token that expires
Mouse movement detection - Flag accounts with robotic behavior
Time-on-page thresholds - Viewing 50 opportunities in 10 minutes triggers review
IP + device fingerprinting - Detect account sharing/abuse
Watermarking - Embed user ID invisibly in displayed content
Rate limit escalation - Slow down requests after threshold

Data Obfuscation for Free/Preview

Show fragments: "Consumers report difficulty with [REDACTED] when trying to..."
Display aggregated insights without raw data
Use summary statistics instead of individual examples

The "Netflix Model" Approach
Show enough to create FOMO, not enough to satisfy:
Preview Layer (Always Visible)

Problem headline: "Pet owners struggle with inconsistent medication schedules"
Tags: Healthcare, Pet Care, Consumer Apps
Validation score: 87/100
Geographic fit: Strong in US, UK, AU
Comment count: 234 discussions
Trend: ↗ +23% growth last 30 days

Behind Paywall

Actual consumer quotes
Source URLs and discussions
Detailed validation methodology
Market size estimates
Competitive analysis
Business model suggestions
AI-generated deliverables

Psychological Positioning
Frame scarcity as value protection:
"We limit views per month to ensure our opportunities remain high-value and non-saturated. Unlike generic idea lists, Katalyst opportunities are actively curated and not widely disseminated."
Create urgency:

"47 people viewed this opportunity this week"
"Trending in your target market"
"New opportunities added daily - don't miss out"

Bundle complementary value:

Pro tier includes market monitoring alerts
Business tier includes competitive tracking
Enterprise gets custom research requests

Monetization Multipliers
Microtransactions for power users:

Buy 10 additional views for $29
Unlock specific high-demand categories (à la carte)
Purchase individual AI reports ($49 each)

Consultation upsells:

"Need help validating this opportunity? Book a strategy session ($299)"
"Want us to conduct deeper research on this market? Custom project quote"

The Critical Balance
Your quota system should feel generous enough to be useful but scarce enough to prevent extraction:

50 views/month (Pro) = ~1-2 serious evaluations per day
200 views/month (Business) = Multiple team members exploring actively
This prevents someone from systematically downloading your entire database while still allowing legitimate business research

The key insight: You're not selling opportunities, you're selling validated market intelligence. The raw data is less valuable than your curation, validation, and packaging. Even if someone extracts 200 opportunities, they're still getting your analysis framework and quality filtering - which is the real moat.
