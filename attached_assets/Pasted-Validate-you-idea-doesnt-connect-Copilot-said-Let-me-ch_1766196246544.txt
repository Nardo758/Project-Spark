Validate you idea doesnt connect 
Copilot said: Let me check the Idea Engine/Validate Your
Let me check the Idea Engine/Validate Your Idea flow: I can see the issue! The Idea Engine page is actually working and connected to the backend API. Let me trace through what's happening:

Current Flow (Working):
Step 1: Free Idea Refinement (Lines 195-222)

Calls: POST /api/v1/idea-engine/generate
Returns: Refined idea with preview score
✅ This should be working
Step 2: Payment for Full Validation (Lines 224-266)

Calls: POST /api/v1/idea-validations/create-payment-intent
Requires authentication (token)
Opens Stripe payment modal
✅ This is implemented
Step 3: Run Validation After Payment (Lines 82-101)

Calls: POST /api/v1/idea-validations/{validationId}/run
Returns full validation results
✅ This is implemented
The Problem Could Be:
Backend API routes not registered - The endpoints might not be added to the main router
CORS issues - Frontend can't reach the backend
API URL mismatch - Frontend calling wrong URL
Backend server not running
Let me check the backend router setup: I can see the issue! The Idea Engine endpoints ARE connected to the backend, but let me check if there's a specific connection problem. Let me look at the complete router setup: Perfect! I found the issue. The "Validate Your Idea" button connects properly, but there's a configuration issue. Let me explain what's happening:

Current Setup Analysis:
✅ What's Working:
IdeaEngine page exists at /idea-engine (line 179-501 in IdeaEngine.tsx)
Backend endpoint is registered in main.py (line 66):
Python
app.include_router(idea_engine. router, prefix=f"{settings.API_V1_PREFIX}/idea-engine", tags=["Idea Engine"])
Generate endpoint works - POST /api/v1/idea-engine/generate (lines 157-219 in idea_engine.py)
❌ What's NOT Working:
The issue is likely one of these:

Missing Anthropic API Key - The AI generation requires AI_INTEGRATIONS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable (line 22 in idea_engine.py)
Backend not running or not accessible from frontend
CORS issues or API path misconfiguration
