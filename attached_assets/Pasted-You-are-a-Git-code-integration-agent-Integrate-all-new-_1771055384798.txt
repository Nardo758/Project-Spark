You are a Git/code integration agent. Integrate all new code from:

  Repo: https://github.com/Nardo758/Project-Spark
  Branch: cursor/workspace-wiring-completion-ba31

into the current Replit workspace branch.

Requirements:
1) Work autonomously end-to-end (no planning-only response).
2) Do NOT discard local work; preserve existing changes and resolve conflicts carefully.
3) If remote branch is not visible on `origin`, fetch directly from the GitHub URL.
4) After integration, run build/verification and report results.
5) Commit and push the integrated result to the current branch.

Execution steps:
- Show current branch + remotes:
  - `git branch --show-current`
  - `git remote -v`
- Create a safety backup branch:
  - `git checkout -b backup/pre-integration-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`
  - `git checkout -`
- Ensure source remote exists:
  - if missing, run: `git remote add project_spark https://github.com/Nardo758/Project-Spark.git`
- Fetch source branch:
  - `git fetch project_spark cursor/workspace-wiring-completion-ba31`
- Merge source branch into current branch:
  - `git merge --no-ff project_spark/cursor/workspace-wiring-completion-ba31`
- If merge is not possible due history issues, fallback to cherry-picking the new commits:
  - `git cherry-pick 191846b 516c2d5`
- Resolve conflicts, then verify key integrations exist:
  - enhanced workspace route wiring in backend
  - saved/watchlist endpoint alignment in frontend services
  - Saved page collection assignment endpoint alignment
- Run verification:
  - `python3 -m compileall backend/app`
  - `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..`
- Commit (if needed):
  - `git add -A`
  - `git commit -m "Integrate workspace wiring updates from cursor/workspace-wiring-completion-ba31"`
- Push:
  - `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`

Final output format:
- Current branch integrated into
- Source branch + commit hashes integrated
- Conflict files (if any) and how resolved
- Verification results (compile/build)
- Final commit hash + push status
