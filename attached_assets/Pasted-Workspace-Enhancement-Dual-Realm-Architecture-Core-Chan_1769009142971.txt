Workspace Enhancement: Dual-Realm Architecture
Core Changes
1. User AI Integration
Enable users to connect their own AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, custom LLMs) to the Workspace, allowing them to leverage their preferred AI tools while accessing OppGrid's intelligence infrastructure.
2. Opportunity-Type Segmentation
Restructure Workspace to support two distinct opportunity categories with specialized toolsets:

Physical Realm: Location-Based Opportunities
For brick-and-mortar businesses, service areas, and location-dependent ventures
Foundation Tool: Deep Clone

Source business analysis (business type inference, address parsing)
Real-time demographic intelligence (Census API integration)
Competitive landscape mapping (SerpAPI competitor data)
Multi-radius target analysis (3-mile and 5-mile zones, parallel processing)
Match scoring algorithm (65-95% confidence range)
Success factor extraction (competition density, income alignment, market growth)

Supporting Tools:

Trade Area Analyzer (demographic overlays)
Real Estate Intelligence (property availability, zoning, costs)
Competition Heatmaps
Demographic Trend Forecasting
Site Selection Scoring Matrix

User Workflow:

Select Physical Realm opportunity
Run Deep Clone analysis on comparable successful business
Review multi-city match scores
Deep-dive into top target locations
Export location strategy report
Connect AI agent for custom business plan refinement


Digital Realm: Online Business Opportunities
For SaaS, e-commerce, content platforms, and location-independent ventures
Foundation Workflow:
Phase 1: Strategic Planning

AI-powered business plan generation
Market validation (TAM/SAM/SOM analysis)
Competitive positioning framework
Revenue model design

Phase 2: Product Design

Wireframing tools (integrate Figma/Whimsical API?)
User flow mapping
Feature prioritization matrix
MVP scope definition

Phase 3: Technical Implementation (need to define)

Development framework recommendations?
Tech stack selector?
Launch checklist?
Growth tool recommendations?
