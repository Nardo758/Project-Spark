Design Recommendation: Progressive Input Flow
Option 1: Shared Foundation

Start with core inputs that apply to ALL reports
Then add report-specific questions based on selection

Option 2: Smart Inheritance

Feasibility Study (FREE) captures basics
If user upgrades to paid reports, pre-fill from Feasibility Study
Only ask for additional needed fields

Option 3: Quick vs. Detailed Mode

"Quick Generate" = minimal inputs (system makes assumptions)
"Detailed/Custom" = full questionnaire for precision


UX Considerations

Field Descriptions: Include helper text like "This helps us analyze local competition and market conditions"
Optional vs. Required:

Mark optional fields clearly
More inputs = better report, but don't overwhelm


Save Progress: Allow users to save partially completed forms
Pre-populate from Opportunity: If generating from a specific opportunity card, auto-fill what you already know (location, category, problem statement)
Example Values: Show placeholder examples: "e.g., Mobile coffee cart in downtown Seattle"
