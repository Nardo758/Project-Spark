i need to refine the process from idea discover to Deep dive so this can be structed in a way that makes sense.  the process should be more in-depth the father a user decides to dig in

Dec 11
I'll help you refine the process flow from idea discovery through to deep dive. Let me analyze the current navigation and propose a more structured, progressive depth model.

Research Dashboard (4 sections, tabbed interface)
    ↓  
Deep Dive (6 comprehensive sections, full report format)
Would you like me to create detailed wireframes showing how this progressive depth structure would work visually? Or would you prefer to focus on refining the specific content within any particular tier?

yes

Dec 11
I'll create detailed wireframes showing the progressive depth structure. Let me start by reading the relevant design skill to ensure production-quality output.

Reading the frontend design skill to create high-quality wireframes for the progressive depth structure
Now I'll create an interactive wireframe showing all three tiers with progressive disclosure. I'll use a clean, editorial aesthetic that matches your Perplexity Finance reference with Spectral serif headlines.

This works, but what is the user flow that leads to this ?

Dec 11
Great question! Let me map out the complete user flow from initial discovery to Deep Dive. This will help us understand how users actually arrive at these different tiers.


Creating a comprehensive user flow diagram showing the complete journey from discovery to deep dive, including entry points, decision moments, and conversion paths
katalyst-user-flow.jsx

Presented file
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive user flow visualization showing three distinct paths that lead users to the Deep Dive tier:

Three User Journeys:
1. Browse Flow (Organic Discovery)
Entry: Landing page → Value props → "Browse Opportunities"
Discovery Feed: Curated cards with validation scores
Click card → Problem Detail (Free)
Upgrade CTA → Research Dashboard (Pro)
Second upgrade → Deep Dive (Business) + AI Assistant
Volume: Highest | Intent: Lowest | Conversion: Gradual
2. Search Flow (Intent-Driven)
Entry: Search bar with specific query ("home maintenance")
Results: Filtered opportunities sorted by relevance
Click result → Problem Detail (Free)
Then follows same path as browse flow
Volume: Medium | Intent: High | Conversion: Faster (skip discovery)
3. Submission Flow (Problem Submitter)
Entry: User submitted problem months ago
Re-engagement: Email notification when problem validates
Returns with emotional investment ("This was MY problem!")
Views "their" opportunity → Higher engagement
Strongest conversion → Wants to see all submissions
Volume: Smallest | Intent: Highest | Conversion: Best (personal stake)
Key Conversion Moments:
Problem Detail → Research Dashboard: "Is this worth exploring deeper?"
Research Dashboard → Deep Dive: "Ready to move from research to execution?"
What Makes This Work:
Progressive disclosure - Each tier reveals more, never overwhelming
Clear value props at each upgrade point
Emotional hooks especially for submitters
AI Assistant as the premium differentiator in Deep Dive
Multiple entry points capture different user types
Click through the tabs to see how each flow differs in user psychology and conversion strategy!
