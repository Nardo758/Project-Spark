## State & Industry-Specific Automation

### Geographic Intelligence Integration

```
🤖 AI uses your business location (from business plan) to:

1. Auto-select appropriate state requirements
2. Calculate state-specific fees
3. Identify industry-specific licenses
4. Determine sales tax obligations
5. Generate state-specific documents
6. Set compliance deadlines
7. Estimate state taxes

Example:
User's business: FinTech SaaS in Austin, Texas
        ↓
AI automatically knows:
• Texas has no state income tax ✅
• Sales tax applies to SaaS (8.25% in Austin)
• FinCEN registration may be required
• Franchise tax report due May 15
• Money transmitter license evaluation needed
• CCPA applies if serving CA customers
        ↓
All guidance, documents, and checklists are Texas-specific
