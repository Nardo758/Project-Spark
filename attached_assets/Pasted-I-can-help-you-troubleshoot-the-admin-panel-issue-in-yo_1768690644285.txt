I can help you troubleshoot the admin panel issue in your Project-Spark repository. Let me first take a look at your repository structure to understand what you have built. I can see you have an admin. html file in your repository! Let me check its contents to help you understand what's in there: Good news! You definitely have an admin panel built in your repository! Let me show you what I found:

✅ Admin Panel Components
1. Frontend Admin Panel
You have a complete admin interface at:

admin. html (252,768 bytes - quite comprehensive!)
Also duplicated at frontend/public/admin.html

Your backend has a complete admin infrastructure:

Admin Router (backend/app/routers/admin. py):

Admin statistics dashboard

3. Admin Access Control
In backend/app/core/dependencies.py:

Python
async def get_current_admin_user(
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
) -> User:
    """Get the current admin user"""
    if not current_user.is_admin:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Admin access required"
        )
    return current_user

🎯 Admin Account Setup
Based on backend/init_db.py, you can set up admin access by:

Setting admin emails - The code references m.dixon5030@gmail.com as an admin
Database flag - The is_admin flag in the users table must be set to True
📋 To Verify Your Admin Panel:
Access the admin panel at: http://your-domain/admin. html
Ensure your user account has is_admin = True in the database
The admin panel requires authentication with an admin account
