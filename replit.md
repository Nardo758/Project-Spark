# OppGrid - Opportunity Intelligence Platform

## Overview
OppGrid is an AI-powered opportunity intelligence platform designed to help users discover, validate, and act on business opportunities. It provides a structured approach from identifying market frictions to connecting users with experts and resources. The platform aims to be an "AI Startup Factory," offering AI-driven analysis, expert marketplaces, subscription-based content gating, and pay-per-unlock features to foster innovation and entrepreneurial success, with a vision to democratize access to high-quality business intelligence.

## User Preferences
I want iterative development, with a focus on delivering core features quickly and refining them based on feedback. Prioritize modular and reusable code. I prefer clear, concise explanations and direct answers. Ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new external dependencies. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file.

## System Architecture
OppGrid utilizes a modern hybrid architecture with a React 18 frontend (Vite, TailwindCSS) on Port 5000 and a Python FastAPI backend (SQLAlchemy ORM) on Port 8000, backed by a Replit PostgreSQL database. Client-side state is managed with Zustand, and routing with React Router v6. The frontend proxies `/api/*` requests to the backend.

Florida data includes 21,382 road segments with traffic counts ranging 20-301,000 AADT. Uses spatial queries (ST_DWithin, ST_AsGeoJSON) for fast road segment retrieval within radius. Traffic visualization colors roads green→yellow→red based on intensity. Database table: `traffic_roads`. Import script: `backend/scripts/import_florida_traffic_data.py`.
