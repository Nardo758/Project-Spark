If you’ve ever thought *“I wish there was a league that actually let me build something weird and see it play out”* — this is probably it.

UPDATE: I''ll keep adding my feedback to this review. I drive the car almost daily, so come back for updates! 


I am going to "own" the MG IM5 Standard Range for the next 3 years.

I have got the car for a few days, did some miles on it trying all the things, and I can release a first review, someone asked for it so here it is!

Background:  
Tech Savvy male in early forties, used to cars since 18 and before. Owned AlfaRomeo, BMW, Renault, Peugeot, Mercedes, Nissan, Ford, Opel/Vauxhall, Toyota... and some.

This is my first EV after a 2021 Peugeot 508 2.0 Diesel. I was considering a Jaecoo J7, so I will do a bit of comparison in this review. 

Pros:

* The car is indeed beautiful. 
* Sporty enough for the intended audience
   * It''s quick. Boy it is quick.
* Lots and lots of tech
* Mileage is discreet, but change the range type to DMRS (or something like that) to have a more real estimate of the remaining range
* Cornering is dope. The rear steering wheels are incredible, every car should have them (was the same with my old Nissan Fairlady back in the early 2000s)
* The cameras are real good quality, nothing close to my old 508!
   * But the rear manouvering one still gets dirt due to the position
   * The "rear mirror" one it''s always good because it''s on the fin on the roof
* Overall it''s really well built. Can''t fault anything
* I don''t miss the central rear mirror. The camera is really good
* Speakers are quite nice. Initially I thought they sounded worse than the cardboard speakers in my 508 (which are actually quite good), but it was just about finding the right settings. They don''t like to play loud, though. 
* The 360 camera, albeit not as good as the Jaecoo''s, does a real good job. 
* Trunk space is good enough, but being this kind of a coupe, it''s low. Not as low as my 508, though. You can load plenty
* Despite being only a few cms longer than my 508 it is is way more spacious. The rear seats are so far! :D 
* The crab walking is quite good! I thought it was a gimmick, and perhaps it is, but it turned out helpful a couple times
* The autoparking feature is quite aggressive, but doesn''t miss a shot. Perfect and fast parking all the time
* The embedded sim card has real strong signal. Even when my phone doesn''t have reception, this one''s really good. 
* The tech feels more european than the Jaecoo. Even though it''s required, there''s a fast way to disable all the ADAS in (almost) one button. 
   * I mean to say, it doesn''t scream chinese car like the Jaecoo does. It feels more european in this sense.
* Despite not having matrix light, the illumination at night is really good. So good I''m afraid it blinds other drivers, but noone beamed so far, so I guess it''s good.
* Can''t obviously comment on the photo-cromatic sunroof just yet, since we''ve got no sun in the Cotswolds, but "it seems ok" :D
