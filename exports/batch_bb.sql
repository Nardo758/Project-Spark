An **example** of a case I like is the Hyte Y70 black case (with touchscreen), or the ASUS pro art black wood, or a Fractal Design North, **but if there''s a case you think looks better, please feel free to choose it. I just want good airflow, quiet, and good sleek, mature, minimalist black aesthetics. Touchscreen/LCD is cool too, but not required.**

**The quieter the better** \- please also tell me ***exactly*** which case fans to get (type, quantity, price, where to mount, etc.) along with the exact AIO Liquid cooler. **I don''t know anything about case fans, as this is my first computer that I''m building.**

Please also recommend the highest possible end 32 inch 4k monitor (Non curved please) and a top tier gaming mouse and keyboard (These can be RGB if only the best performing ones are - but if there''s any minimalist/non RGB top tier, than that''s preferable). PLEASE DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING THAT WILL GHOST PRESS DOUBLE INPUTS LIKE THOSE GARBAGE RAZER KEYBOARDS. I want the best quality for both gaming and regular typing.

Finally, please share a link to a good YOUTUBE video on how to build a computer. I''m overwhelmed by the options I am finding and don''t know which is best. This is my FIRST TIME building a gaming PC, so I know very little.

To celebrate, we’re hosting a special Build Challenge, but we’ll get into that more in a bit. First we want to show off some of the top posts from the past year (according to our insights).
