We all know that just one click on her profile would reveal she was a dude posting memes about chest day last week and commenting on post by other girls "HMU out of DMs" And yet… we believe. Every single time. Its amazing to see how naive & horny we guys are.

The funny (or sad... you choose) part is you see a person out of no where confessing, "Got scammed by "HornyGurl69", he was a guy, dont trust him guys!!!" only to see the same person go back to another post and comment "HMU out of DMs".

Honestly, I tell my friends thes days..

Feeling sad?   
Heartbroken?   
Broke?  
  
Forget therapy.

Go read the comment section of any NSFW post, you’ll laugh so hard, your soul will reboot ...True story.

- I love investigative journalism or anything that looks into the why and what of things. I love channels like Johnny Harris, Veritasium, Vox, TED, and pbsstoried.
- Work as a (digital) product designer and a homebody when I''m not working. I love to travel and anything involving the outdoors though, as long as you prepare the itinerary :P

“But hey, at least you beat the commies, right?” Louis said, handing his friend another beer.

Ivan laughed heartily as he shook his head, an awkward smile on his face. He leaned forward to grab the can. That sense of humor missed the mark way more often than it didn’t, but that laugh was definitely one he needed that early on a Sunday.
