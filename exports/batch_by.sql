I never felt that way about LN/SN styling competitions, for example. (Which, by the way, I can''t believe we STILL don''t have in this game?!) I know some people do, but I''ve seen plenty of f2p players win or score high on those competitions. But this... this is just *really* heavily pay-to-win.

And that makes me sad! Not gonna lie, idiot me actually had some real hope during those first few days when y''all were encouraging me! (And I love you for it, really, this community is genuinely very supportive.) Bit personal but we''re planning to start a family (in this economy?? lol) and I thought getting some extra money from that competition in the form of IKEA gift card could be really helpful for that! I could be both relaxing enjoying my game and possibly getting a bit of money out of it, that was a really good motivator.

Been putting in real strong effort into a cool build that I can actually *afford* in time, and now I''m just..yeah idk I stopped bothering and went to play Silksong instead, because the seeds and fries are eating through my Astralites and I''m already 300 diamonds down, I don''t wanna sink more when I know there will *always* be people willing to sink even more. I should have realised earlier that this is yet another "rich get richer" situation.

Anyway thanks for listening to my salt, I don''t normally make posts like this... but this really got me down lol. I''ll still finish my build whenever I have enough materials just to have a cool house, but I''ve pretty much given up on the competition. 😔

EDIT: Post possibly cancelled?! Sort of? This person figured out a way to take photos in build mode. Still annoying to go around it like that but... it''s an option........? 👀

I wake up at 5am for it and spend an atrocious amount of time building. I love building. Truly. People enjoy my cave, start telling me to enter the competition, damn, didn''t expect that - okay!! Let''s lock in and do this!!\n\nI load up a new scheme and start working on a massive Cave 2.0 build. I work on it for multiple hours every day. I try my best to use low cost materials where I can, but no matter how much I try, I still can see that there''s no way I''ll make it unless I shell out at least some diamonds on Astralites to keep growing fish and flowers. Okay fine. 50 diamonds here, 50 there...\n\nAt this point, the playing field still seems sort of level. Housing insight is limited for everyone, yeah you can accelerate crafting, but everyone needs to wait for the flowers and fish to grow, right? I diligently keep running Nikki all day every day, farming those flowers non-stop...\n\nAnd then around 5-6 days later I start seeing insane builds, and realise you can just buy materials with Astralites. This is where my motivation plumeted.\n\nI truly, genuinely wish that buying Astralites for diamonds was *blocked until the competition was over*. To give everyone an ACTUAL level playing field, where we are ALL limited the same way and have to really ramp up the creativity department to work around these limits. But no, instead it''s a wallet slinging competition...\n\nAnd this isn''t to say there''s no creativity in slinging your wallet. That RV build that was popular here last week was INSANE and genuinely I could never be that galaxy brained. There''s obviously nuance.\n\nBut a lot of the cool housing I see is just people using a lot of expensive items to make it look impressive, and that completely ruins the spirit of the competition for me.\n\nI never felt that way about LN/SN styling competitions, for example.

Why am I NEVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? I try and I try and I try and you don''t care. It comes down to you not loving me enough. Plain and simple.

I would''ve done anything to be with you. I moved across the country twice to be with you. I surprised you for your birthday less than a month ago for a weekend getaway. I thought about you every day. I loved being with you, just watching a movie or being lazy. I loved cooking for you. I loved living with you. 

I try and I try and I try and I am never good enough for you. You broke up with me a year and a half ago for having no "work eithic" and no direction. We got back together. Now I have a great job and am starting grad school and yet you still dump me again. Now I have direction and it''s still not good enough. You call me selfish, you call me self-possessed. Does that make you feel better blaming it all on me? I accepted you despite your faults, why couldn''t you do the same? I didn''t know these issues were still bothering you...and you call me uncommunicative. 

You''ll never find anyone who loved you as much as I did. I know someday I''ll find someone who loves me more than you ever did though.

I''ve lost 6 pounds already, in the span of 5 days. I need pills to sleep at night. I''m an empty shell. I went to therapy this morning and cried my eyes out. I can''t believe we still have to live together through this. You knew I didn''t know if my job would become permanent until next month. You knew I was starting grad school in a few weeks. You knew I had to take my car into the shop and had no ride to work except for you. You knew all this and you still dumped me. I''m so hurt. I''m so angry. Mainly I''m so dissappointed in you - that you could treat me like this. I could NEVER do this to you - I guess that''s why we are so different.
