* Catching the perfect thread… hours after the conversation died
* Feeling like I was always late to help anyone

And the worst part ?

I kept wondering how many conversations I *never* even saw.

Eventually I hit a point where I thought:

*"There has to be a better way to find people who actually need what I’m building, right when they need it."*

So I built **Leadlee**.

It’s super simple, but it pretty much solved the problem for me:

* **It monitors the communities** where my potential customers hang out
* **It cuts the noise**, only surfacing posts where someone has a real need
* **It notifies me instantly**, so I can jump into the conversation while it''s still alive - not after it''s frozen over

And honestly?

It’s taken a ridiculous amount of stress off my plate.

Instead of chasing threads all day, I get actual opportunities delivered to me *exactly when they matter*.

Now I’m opening it up to early users, because I have a feeling I’m not the only one who’s been missing out on conversations that could’ve changed everything.

So I’d love to hear from you:

1. Do you feel like you miss customer conversations just because you don’t see them in time?
2. What would you want a tool like this to track for you first ?
3. How much time do you think this could save you each week ?

Happy to answer questions about how it works.
