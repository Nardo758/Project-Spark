The man was pleasant enough, a warm smile always ready, laughter quick and genuine, with a wit that came as naturally as breathing.\n\nBut Li’s habit of speaking in riddles, and worse, his probing questions about Troy’s past, gnawed at him. In another time, in another place, Troy might’ve welcomed the companionship. In a world like this, men like Li are never to be taken for granted. Troy might’ve come clean about everything if they’d met under different circumstances. But with trust a precious commodity, caution was the smarter play.\n\n“So…” Troy leaned back slightly, hoping to redirect the conversation off himself. “You called this little place the ‘Village of the Lost.’ Why’s that?”\n\n“Hm? Ah, yes, yes!” Li’s face lit up as he refilled his cup, dropping in a pinch of fresh herbs. “I suppose that does need explaining for one who explores so far from home .”\n\n*Explore. Ha. I wish,* Troy kept the thought to himself.\n\nWith a sip, the horsekin savored the change in flavor before continuing. “The name ‘Village of the Lost’ is what us locals call it. But among travelers and wandering cultivators, it is known by another name… the Temple of Mulan.”\n\n“Am I right in guessing that refers to the giant temple I passed on the way in?” Troy asked.\n\n“The one and only!” Li’s eyes shone with pride, his voice swelling as though the very air demanded reverence, “Dedicated to the legendary Qin Mulan, warrior, savior, and slayer of the dreaded Lady Bone Demon!” He leaned forward, lowering his tone to a near-whisper, as if even speaking the demon’s name risked drawing unwanted evil. “When the heavens trembled and the earth split under the terror of demon and her undead horde, Mulan alone stood defiant. With her legendary Lance of Magra, spirit unbroken, and her will tempered by suffering, she banished the demon and sealed her beneath the heart of the world, never again to rise in the mortal realm again.”\n\nTroy’s brow furrowed. A nice story, but not really what he wanted to know. “Alright… then why do the locals call it the Village of the Lost?”\n\n“It’s more chance than design.” Li swirled his tea in a manner most tranquil, taking a soothing sip. “Back in my youth, lords came here to meditate, seeking visions of what lay ahead their great journeys under Qin’s guidance.” His gaze drifted toward a battered wooden donation bucket in the corner, its faded Mandarin inscription nearly erased by time. He chuckled softly, almost wistfully. “When I took up the mantle of temple keeper, their visits dwindled. The last I can remember was the magistrate of Grand Nanhu City more than twenty years ago. And even then, her pilgrimage felt more like… an *inspection* than devotion.”\n\n*…Was this place some kind of ancient tourist trap?* Troy let the thought pass. “Seems risky, having so many powerful beings gather in one place.”\n\n“Strange as they may seem to you, foreigner, their presence is as old as the bones of the earth itself,” Li replied. “Yes, it can be dangerous, but Qin’s blessing lingers here still. A friend to mortals, a thorn to the powers above. That rebellious spirit drew many cultivators who sought to follow her path. A true ‘hidden master’ of legend.”\n\nFor a moment, Li’s smile faltered. “Perhaps that says more of the age we live in… or about the lords themselves.” Then his grin returned. “Still, our village welcomes all manner of wanderers, mortal or not. Most who set foot here pursued meaning.”\n\nTroy smirked. “Not sure that applies to me. I already know what I want.”\n\n“Oh? And what is *your* pursuit, stranger?”\n\n“Once I get home and finish my service, I’m going to be a simple little farmer in bumfuck nowhere. Then it’s smooth sailing from there.”\n\nThe horseman gave his whinny-like laugh. “*Bumfuck!* What a peculiar incantation! *Bum… fuck.* It rolls off the tongue like a drunkard’s chant. How vulgar, yet strangely soulful. A word of foreign lands indeed! I shall remember it. Qin would’ve loved such audacity.”\n\nTroy tilted his head in confusion, but Li continued. “A simple wish, yet no less a desire.
