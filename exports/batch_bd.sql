**What I like? (sorted by best at the top)**

1. Hamish streams and videos - this just has to be numero uno 🫡, he''s just really really friendly and positive, he''s the face of this game right now and he''s doing a great job.
2. The progression system and leagues, that phase before hitting eternals feels very clear in terms of game progression, milestones are visible, gear upgrades, finishing a capstone in time and moving on to the next difficulty simply feels good and rewarding.
3. It may feel dumb to ‘like’ such a simple thing, but the Interrupt system is just amazing to me, no idea if there are other games that has implemented this in a similar/exact way or not, personally I didn’t see something like that anywhere else. the simplicity of me marking a target so everyone now knows “okie, this one is taken care of” is just awesome.
4. The dungeons, the art, boss fights, really really well done, I specifically like the capstone. I especially love Cithrel’s Fall and Wraithtide, I dig the fact that there are 3 bosses and I get to choose the order I get to tackle them, I can build my route the way I want.
5. The patch cadence feels good, feels like the game is getting more than decent attention on a weekly basis.
6. Attention to details, I have a bunch of examples, but let’s pick just one, to me, things like the hidden holiday bear mount shows the love for the game by the devs.

**What I dislike and would love to see getting addressed and improved**  
**(again sorted by my highest priority at the top)**

1. No ‘bad luck’ protection in legendaries, in my eyes, this should be a top priority and relatively easy to address. legendaries have huge impact on your gameplay and damage/healing, it feels really really bad not getting your ‘needed’ legendary. For example, my main is Helena, I had amazing luck and got the exact legendary that I’ve wanted after a few champion dungeons runs.. it felt great. but on my Mara, the only viable legendary right now are the boots, the boots provide incredible gains to energy regeneration and damage, the two other legendaries are trash in comparison…. And I’ve had zero luck, did like 100+ eternals… not even 1 legendary, not even the ones that are bad. I do so little damage compared to characters with legendary that sometimes groups just kick me in the middle of the run and say that they’re sorry but I do no damage. luckily, this week on the economy update, I just bought a bunch of purple mithrils and rerolled boots for a bunch of times until I got that legendary at 255 ilvl. Now I’m having much more fun and my damage has improved tremendously. If it was my ‘main char’ and not an alt, I might have been so frustrated by now that I’d take a break, might even quit.
2. In queues, there are often less tanks/healers compared to dps players, I think adding some kind of ''extra reward'' for in-demand roles may motivate more players to try out those roles.. for example, if there''s currently low amounts of tanks in queue, add a ''X bonus marks of fellowship'' for tanks, it might encourage more people to try different roles.
3. When I queue, current dungeon selection window pops-up and the entire screen is blurred.. I wish the chat window will stay visible and functional. it’s a team game, let us coordinate our selection. currently, a lot of times the dungeon being selected gets someone to leave, for example, 3 players pick a capstone, then when we’ve loaded the map and we’re all in, tank types “I don’t have the time for capstone, sorry” and leaves……and then I’m back to another 10 min of queue. If we had chat, he would write it in the selection window and we could have just picked something else or something.
4. the nameplates just feels broken on huge pulls. when there are more than 12-15 mobs in a pack, once they’re stacked together, seeing a cast go out is luck-based, it all depends on the way the order the nameplates stacked up, you can easily miss an important cast and wipe. I wish there was a way to manually choose priority mobs so they’re always shown OR just edit the nameplates and make mobs hp bar super thin and their cast bar larger.
5. Gem grind, do I need to ellaborate? I wish it would at least be account-wide.
6. Dungeon Codex, currently only shows gear drops, I wish it would show enemies spells, boss mechanics explanations and relevant dungeon information.
7. E20 and E40, what’s the actual difference between them? I wish the game would just show useful information about the levels, for example: E20: - Enemies have +1000% HP - Enemies deal +250% more damage E40: - Enemies have +2000% HP - Enemies deal +500% more damage

What I am looking for: 

Over all performance; speed, memory, storage -  For storage on the MacBook Pro specifically, do you think I can get by on 512GB or should I go for the 1TB? I’ve had people tell me that the 1TB is excessive and takes a life time to fill up. But I’ve also heard that it actually isn’t that much and can be filled up within 2 years, especially with photos and videos. I have also been told that the 1TB has faster processors- is that true? 

Longevity - If I’m investing into something like this, I want it to last for several years. That is also where the storage and memory comes in. Does that affect anything? Is one going to last me longer than the other? I obviously know that storage will eventually run out, but there are external things I can use for storage. 

Portability - I absolutely love the screen size of the 16 inch MacBook Pro, but I’ve heard it’s not ideal to travel with like the 14 inch is. I visit family a lot and I’ll be shooting a wedding in Maine in September. Something that I can take on the plane so I can edit would be ideal. So my question is…is the 16 inch MacBook Pro worth the hassle for the screen size alone? 

The goal is to get both the MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. The MacBook for the main things and iPad for editing specifically. They will primarily be used for photo editing, video editing and I would like to get into creating digital art. I will also eventually be using this for online classes when I go back to school and promoting my work. 

One thing that I have found with my own research is that the iPad Pro with the magic keyboard essentially becomes like a MacBook. If I were to get the iPad Pro, 13inch, 2TB of storage with the magic keyboard…do you think I could bypass getting the MacBook for now and be able to accomplish everything that I am wanting? The amount of content creation isn’t going to be too insane for the first year and I know that I can get an adapter to plug into the iPad to upload my photos. I also won’t be starting classes for a while yet.

Baby is 5mos. I got these Broadway tickets as a special Christmas gift for my husband who loves Broadway. We got tickets to Maybe Happy Ending - if y''all know the controversy and you wanted to see it with Darren Criss you know you''ve got to pounce when he comes back on stage for a limited time. I got the tickets months in advance, planned a nice dinner for 4:30pm, paid for overnight childcare to start at 2:30 pm (2 hours before dinner reservation to give us plenty of buffer -usually takes 45 min to get to Manhattan), I paid to get parking for the whole day (just in case). 

The week was rough starting with a funeral (husband''s grandma), lots of family visiting so baby pretty much skipped a nap per day and every night was hard but manageable. On Thursday our routines started to normalize and we were getting him back on track. 

Day of date night I woke up middle of the night to pump to make sure there was enough breastmilk for baby. I pumped throughout the day whenever I could after a feed - haakaa on one side baby on the other. I got him through all his naps - both contact naps for about 1.5 hrs each at 9:30am and 1pm - stuck to wake windows and baby was the calmest he''d ever been since teething 1 month ago (yes early teether lucky us). He''s a really good baby overall- very smiley and friendly, always has been since day 3 he knew how to smile. He''s also pretty darn good with strangers - we had a prospective nanny come in the day before and he let her do a contact nap and didn''t cry even once with her. And super playful, even going to her with arms stretched during play.

2:30pm rolls around - sitter is no where to be seen. I checked in on her @2:35pm to make sure she had the address. Baby knows her but we haven''t seen her in a month. She was my postpartum doula and has spent time with baby at least 6-7 times before. I then checked in on her at 2:45 to make sure she was OK. Her response "yes, arrival is at 3 no?"... No we said 2:30 and confirmed the week before and id even sent a screenshot. It''s ok I know this might happen she''s never been on time usually 15-30 min late. It''s fine, I planned for this. She gets in 45 min late at 3:15pm. Husband is waiting for her to get here as I''m feeding baby. But it''s fine, she just has to keep baby calm and try a feed at 7pm, but even if shes unable to I had steamed sweet potato puree in fridge and he started solids weeks ago.

Anyway, we still need to get our dog to the in-laws 15 min away. Ok no big deal we''re on our way and as soon as we drop the dog off, we ask my sister in law and brother in law with live with MIL/FIL if they can go over a bit earlier than expected because it''s been 15 minutes and baby is still crying. SIL is husband''s older sister who loves our baby - they don''t have kids if their own yet. He''s never cried for that long before not even during sleep training. This kid took to sleep training by day 2 and sleeps through the night. Sister in law was still sleeping even though we had been prepping her for two weeks for this. She was supposed to stop by during wake window at 5pm. But they said they would try to come earlier. 

Side story- To be fair, SIL has depression and is also ridiculously lazy, for ex they have two dogs and she rarely walks them even if they need a walk - just two days ago she brought her dogs to our home and at 5:30p when dogs normally get walked we asked if they needed to go out and she was like "oh yea, I mean we can walk them later when G (husband) gets here". Dogs look like they really need a walk and we have a dog too so my husband and I said "oh totally fine, our dog needs to walk too we''ll just walk them all together." So my husband and I got them ready (while baby was strapped to me!). As we''re leaving she''s like "you sure you don''t want me to come with you? (While scrolling on phone, a** on couch with no intention of getting up). No. We''re fine, thank you. This woman has intimacy issues and has a hard time saying "I love you" but claims within the first week she never felt this way before but feels such a strong love and connection to baby. She often texts to ask if she can come by for five minutes just to hold baby. Just to give you an idea. BUT she is relatively good at getting baby to calm down so we''re a bit dependent on her in this moment.

Back to story - were in the car on the way into Manhattan and baby is still crying. It''s been 30 min and I''m having serious anxiety (I have PPA). So husband texts SIL saying hey he''s crying a good amount can you please head over to calm him? For context we are both not good at asking for help and often do all the helping. SIL asks a lot of stupid questions "did sitter say he''s crying or do you know?" We have monitors! Jeez... She says "you know it''s the first time without you guys he might need to adjust..." He''s seen her before! he''s been crying at this point through the back and forth for almost an hour.

But it''s fine, she just has to keep baby calm and try a feed at 7pm, but even if shes unable to I had steamed sweet potato puree in fridge and he started solids weeks ago.\n\nAnyway, we still need to get our dog to the in-laws 15 min away. Ok no big deal we''re on our way and as soon as we drop the dog off, we ask my sister in law and brother in law with live with MIL/FIL if they can go over a bit earlier than expected because it''s been 15 minutes and baby is still crying. SIL is husband''s older sister who loves our baby - they don''t have kids if their own yet. He''s never cried for that long before not even during sleep training. This kid took to sleep training by day 2 and sleeps through the night. Sister in law was still sleeping even though we had been prepping her for two weeks for this. She was supposed to stop by during wake window at 5pm. But they said they would try to come earlier. \n\nSide story- To be fair, SIL has depression and is also ridiculously lazy, for ex they have two dogs and she rarely walks them even if they need a walk - just two days ago she brought her dogs to our home and at 5:30p when dogs normally get walked we asked if they needed to go out and she was like \"oh yea, I mean we can walk them later when G (husband) gets here\". Dogs look like they really need a walk and we have a dog too so my husband and I said \"oh totally fine, our dog needs to walk too we''ll just walk them all together.\" So my husband and I got them ready (while baby was strapped to me!). As we''re leaving she''s like \"you sure you don''t want me to come with you? (While scrolling on phone, a** on couch with no intention of getting up). No. We''re fine, thank you. This woman has intimacy issues and has a hard time saying \"I love you\" but claims within the first week she never felt this way before but feels such a strong love and connection to baby. She often texts to ask if she can come by for five minutes just to hold baby. Just to give you an idea. BUT she is relatively good at getting baby to calm down so we''re a bit dependent on her in this moment.\n\nBack to story - were in the car on the way into Manhattan and baby is still crying. It''s been 30 min and I''m having serious anxiety (I have PPA). So husband texts SIL saying hey he''s crying a good amount can you please head over to calm him? For context we are both not good at asking for help and often do all the helping. SIL asks a lot of stupid questions \"did sitter say he''s crying or do you know?\" We have monitors! Jeez... She says \"you know it''s the first time without you guys he might need to adjust...\" He''s seen her before! he''s been crying at this point through the back and forth for almost an hour. By the time she texts\"leaving now\" he had already", "subreddit" : "r/technology_and_software", "upvotes" : 1, "comments" : 1, "platform" : "reddit", "url" : "", "confidence_score" : 0.85}', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
