“I guess I did, didn’t I?” he said with a shy smile. Louis dug back inside the portable cooler and produced a second beer, this time for himself. Raising his can like a young freedom fighter celebrating the end of the war at some musty frontier tavern, he proclaimed:

“A toast. To my favorite unsung hero of democracy.”

Ivan raised his can back at him, nodding once with feigned reverence. He cracked it open, loud and messy, and Louis followed suit. The foamy taste of victory was followed by two long gulps from each. Weather-chilled cans of Huxley before twelve o’clock; truly, the breakfast of champions.

That morning so far had been a load off his back, he decided. Weather was warmer for the first time since the end of summer, and it was a good change of pace from the usual gray, chilly afternoons he and Louis would spend with their hands in their jacket pockets, trying their hardest to enjoy their weekly meet-up by the time winter was already on its way back.

The two were sitting on their usual lawn chairs, with their backs toward the house as they faced the lake. Anabelle was inside cooking her signature bland pasta dish for the monthly parents and teachers association meeting in just a few hours, and had basically locked the boys outside to prevent them from ruining everything by pretending to help. It was a morning too good to be wasted by trying to pretend you’re useful, the two had agreed anyway, and they were glad to be outside enjoying their choice brand of cheap beer. The air was usually way fresher in Lou and Belle’s little hideaway, especially in mornings like those, which was one of the reasons Ivan enjoyed saving the date. The other, as his tired smile denounced, was his best friend’s company.

They were quiet for a short while, listening to the sounds of nature and staring at the shades of autumn beyond the opposite lakeshore. Louis had the habit of keeping conversation in good spirits whenever he could tell his friend had gone through a rough week, which was sorely frequent, but he knew how to keep a few moments of quiet introspection in between their usual banter for good measure.

“I just wish having beat Ilya’s people would’ve paid for my renovations, at least.”

“Hey”, said Louis, pointing a loose finger at him. “You got a medal.”

“I don’t want medals, I want new roofing.”

“Dismantling a coup d’etát will only get you medals. You want a new house, help them win one next time.”

Ivan smiled and shook his head, once again. He was easy to annoy, but strangely enough he was never bothered by his friend’s casual humor about the duress he was under during the days of the civil war. In a sense, he knew that was the best way to rationalize it. If nothing else, it was pretty much the only one left. Old Lou was just yanking his chain, sure, but deep inside he did feel this stoic sense of accomplishment from his service.

“Medals are okay, I guess”, Ivan mumbled. “Except you can’t eat them. Believe me, I tried.”

Lou snorted. Ivan liked to crack jokes about it, but his friend knew better. For unremarkable working class people such as Ivan, or at least as he always saw himself, having the chance of being part of history was as big of a deal as a long-lasting marriage, or raising healthy children. Except in a strange, collective sense, which he never quite knew how to put into words. It’s not like he ever saw the need to, considering how much of a good job the eggheads at the Praetorian Front propaganda division had done in his place, mostly so he could focus on the shooting.

“Sometimes I wonder if they shouldn’t have won”, he said in a somber, almost deadpan tone.

Looking enviably comfortable in his seat compared to Ivan’s trademark stiffness, Louis just side-eyed his friend with skepticism as he catched that sentence in the middle of a particularly long swig.

“There’s nothing to ‘wonder’ here, comrade”, he said finally, sounding like the sort of expert in speculative history any man in his forties becomes after his third beer before noon. “It would be exactly the same.”

Ivan didn’t laugh. He wasn’t sure if that was one of Lou’s jokes or not.

“Except we’d probably still be at the munitions factory”, Louis quickly added. “Fueling local conflicts until compulsory retirement. And our boss would be Kravchenko’s drunken nephew or something.”

“You mean we’d have dodged Karlsson as our taskmaster?” Ivan asked, this time unable to contain a smile.

He leaned forward to grab the can.

After finishing "vanilla" clans I have bought and completed both Ghost Bears and Clan Wolf DLCs and... I liked it, obviously.

**Ghost Bears DLC:** introduction of Elementals. I liked my little helpers throughout campaigns, and was very sorry when I accidentally shot one or two attacking enemy mech. Fortunately, I have soon learned to use them as a distraction to soften up long range support and/or heavy hitters while my main lance is focusing fire on enemies up close. In other words, focus fire lance (R, F1-F1), send toadies to attack something else (R, F6-F1), in that order.

I *felt* that the DLC was a bit too short, but I liked introduction of new mechs, and many of them! Also, this DLC seemed to be more for the story rather than mech battles. I got impressed by the story more than the missions. I wish there was an alternative ending though.

It was not easy to beat the certain boss, mostly because the battle was timed. I hate timed battles. I hate timed everything since I turned 40, ackshully.

**Wolves of Tukayyid** have been released on my birthday, December 4th, when I turned 45, so I could not miss making myself the gift of my fave franchise DLC. Took me some time to start it after... celebration though. It is not easy to properly recover from celebration when you''re over 40.
