Characters morph slightly, color palettes shift unintentionally, and visual motifs lose coherence.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to explore is whether there''s a current method or at least a developing technique to preserve consistency and narrative linearity in AI-generated video, especially when using tools like Runway, Pika, Sora (eventually), or ControlNet for animation guidance.\n\nTo put it simply:\n\n> Is there a way to treat AI-generated video more like a modern evolution of traditional 2D animation where we can draw in 2D but stitch in 3D, maintaining continuity from shot to shot?\n\n\n\nThink of it like early animation, where consistency across cels was key to audience immersion.

## What’s new since the last post

**1. Local-time reset handling**

- All the old “21:00 UTC” style resets now show in your **local time**, including weekday rollover.
- Daily/weekly checklist descriptions were updated so you don’t have to mentally convert Friday 21:00 UTC anymore.

**2. Mystic tools**

- **Mystic Upgrade Planner**  
  https://besaids.github.io/WWM-Helper/tools/mystic-upgrade-planner  
  Plan mystic upgrades, see total material costs, and compare “damage gained vs mats spent” so you don’t sink mats into trash.

- **Mystic Metrics – Efficiency / Vitality analysis**  
  https://besaids.github.io/WWM-Helper/guides/mystic-metrics  
  Interactive scatter chart for mystic skills; X = vitality cost, Y = damage per vitality, bubble size = total damage. You can highlight strong skills and pin the ones you care about.

- **Mystic Skill Materials guide**  
  https://besaids.github.io/WWM-Helper/guides/mystic-skill-materials  
  Focuses on flowers/materials used for mystic upgrades so you can farm them over time instead of getting stuck later.
