* Multiple model options (GPT, Claude, etc)
* Browser extension and CLI tools

**Cons:**

* Code quality is inconsistent - sometimes great, sometimes meh
* Image-to-code misses styling details often
* Occasionally suggests deprecated methods
* UI feels less polished than competitors
* Free tier has message limits that can be annoying

**Best for:** Quick scripts, prototyping, students/hobbyists on a budget

# My actual workflow now:

I don''t rely on just one. Here''s what I do:

1. **Planning/Architecture** → Claude. I start complex features by discussing the approach with Claude. It''s great at pointing out edge cases I haven''t considered.
2. **Active coding** → Copilot in VS Code. The inline suggestions keep me in flow without context switching.
3. **Quick questions/debugging** → Blackbox. When I need a fast answer and don''t want to leave my browser, it''s convenient.
4. **Learning new tech** → ChatGPT. When picking up a new framework or language, GPT-4 explains things in a way that clicks for me.
5. **Code review** → Claude again. I paste functions and ask it to roast my code. Surprisingly helpful.

# Things I''ve learned:

* **No single AI is perfect for everything.** They all have strengths.
* **Always review generated code.** I''ve wasted hours debugging AI hallucinations.
* **Be specific in prompts.** "Make this faster" vs "Optimize this function for time complexity" gets very different results.
* **Context matters.** Giving the AI your full error message and relevant code makes a huge difference.
* **Don''t get dependent.** I still code without AI assistance regularly so I don''t lose problem-solving skills.', 'Technology & Software', 'OnlyAICoding', 2, 1, 0.1, '$200M-$800M', 'online', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'open', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 'active', '2025-12-15 17:50:24.226892+00:00', '2025-12-15 23:28:13.801671+00:00', NULL, NULL, NULL, TRUE, '2025-12-17 00:38:15.519897', 72, 'AI coding tools lack unified workflow integration; devs juggle multiple subscriptions inefficiently', '$200M-$800M', 'high', 'medium', 'Professional developers using AI tools (5-15 years experience, $80k-150k salary)', 4, '["Unified dashboard/router that intelligently routes coding queries to the best AI tool based on task type", "Cost optimization platform that analyzes usage patterns and recommends optimal subscription combinations", "AI coding assistant aggregator with unified interface and consolidated billing for teams"]', '["First-mover in AI coding tool orchestration/optimization space", "Developer empathy - solving a pain point experienced by early AI adopters who will be mainstream tomorrow"]', '["Extremely high competition - major players (Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic) control the ecosystem and could bundle solutions", "Limited validation signal (1 upvote) suggests this may be more individual preference than widespread pain", "Market may consolidate rapidly as one or two tools dominate, eliminating need for multi-tool workflow", "Tool fatigue is temporary - as AI coding matures, developers will settle on 1-2 preferred tools"]', '["Survey 100+ developers currently using multiple AI coding tools to validate pain intensity and willingness to pay", "Analyze GitHub/Stack Overflow discussions about AI tool switching costs and decision fatigue", "Build MVP: browser extension that tracks which AI tool you use for which tasks and suggests optimization", "Interview engineering managers at 20+ companies about AI tool procurement and standardization challenges"]', 'AI Coding Assistant Comparison Platform & Recommendation Engine', 'Developers waste time and money trying different AI coding assistants without knowing which tool best fits their specific use case, tech stack, or workflow.

Rotated between ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Blackbox for different projects. Here''s my honest breakdown:\n\n# ChatGPT (GPT-4)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Incredible for explaining concepts and breaking down complex problems\n* Great at suggesting multiple approaches to solve something\n* The conversation format makes it easy to iterate and refine\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Code can be unnecessarily verbose and over-commented\n* Sometimes makes assumptions about your tech stack\n* Slower response times during peak hours\n* Can hallucinate library functions that don''t exist\n\n**Best for:** Learning new concepts, architectural discussions, debugging logic errors\n\n# Claude (Sonnet/Opus)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Writes genuinely clean, production-quality code\n* Excellent at refactoring and code review\n* Better at understanding context from longer conversations\n* More careful about edge cases and error handling\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Can be overly cautious and verbose in explanations\n* Slower than other options\n* Sometimes refuses reasonable requests due to content filters\n\n**Best for:** Complex business logic, refactoring legacy code, code reviews\n\n# GitHub Copilot\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Seamless VS Code integration, feels natural while coding\n* Great autocomplete that actually predicts what you need\n* Works offline for basic suggestions\n* Learns your coding style over time\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* $10/month feels steep for what''s essentially fancy autocomplete\n* Sometimes suggests outdated patterns\n* Can be distracting with constant suggestions\n* Limited to code completion, not great for architectural questions\n\n**Best for:** Day-to-day coding, boilerplate reduction, staying in flow state\n\n# Cursor\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Full IDE built around AI, super integrated experience\n* Multi-file editing and context awareness is impressive\n* Can reference entire codebase for suggestions\n* Terminal integration and debugging tools\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Expensive ($20/month)\n* Learning curve if you''re used to VS Code\n* Can be resource-heavy on older machines\n* Overkill if you''re not coding 8+ hours a day\n\n**Best for:** Professional developers, large codebases, teams that want deep AI integration\n\n# Blackbox AI\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Free tier is actually usable (not just a trial)\n* Fast response times even on free plan\n* Image-to-code feature is unique (when it works)\n* Multiple model options (GPT, Claude, etc)\n* Browser extension and CLI tools\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Code quality is inconsistent - sometimes great, sometimes meh\n* Image-to-code misses styling details often\n* Occasionally suggests deprecated methods\n* UI feels less polished than competitors\n* Free tier has message limits that can be annoying\n\n**Best for:** Quick scripts, prototyping, students/hobbyists on a budget\n\n# My actual workflow now:\n\nI don''t rely on just one.
