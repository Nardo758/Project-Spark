- What are you constantly checking a spreadsheet / Discord / random screenshots for?
- Which systems feel like they need a better tracker, planner, or visual explanation?
- If you’re already using the site, which page do you live on, and what feels missing there?

Full disclosure, during the recent Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale, I ordered over $100 of yarn which enabled to me to get the [Rainbow Options Interchangeable Needle Set](https://www.knitpicks.com/rainbow-options-interchangeable-needle-set/p/90306) for free so I spent no money on these directly. TLDR; at the end!

**Cost**

The set retails for $76.99 and includes a variety of size needles and cable lengths.

If you bought all the pieces of the set individually, the total retail cost would be $150.02 for the needles and $19.96 for the cables for a total of $169.98.

**Interchangeable Tips**

The needles are made of rainbow colored laminated birch wood with a metal end piece that connects to the cable. They are 4.75in (12cm) long from tip to tip. There are 9 sizes included in the set - US 4 (3.5mm) | US 5 (3.75mm) | US 6 (4mm) | US 7 4.5mm | US 8 (5mm) | US 9 (5.5mm) | US 10 (6mm) | US10.5 (6.5mm) | US 11 (8mm).

Because the needles are all the same color, they are difficult to tell apart at a glance. The size of each needle is engraved on the end piece, but it is **tiny** so I''d strongly recommend getting a needle gauge if you don''t have one. Its just easier than squinting at the labels.

The needles are very light and have a texture more like plastic than wood due to the lamination. This makes them very smooth and very easy to use. The yarn doesn''t catch at all and they feel great in your hand. As someone who is used to aluminum needles, I like them a lot. If you are used to non-laminated wooden needles, you might find them slipperier than you are used to.

The tips are quite pointy. If you are a person who pushes the needles down with your fingers while you''re knitting (like me) it can hurt. When my fingers get sore, I use a thimble on my index finger and that helps. My assumption is the longer I use them the more they will wear down to a rounder tip so I''m not bothered by this, but it might bother you.

So far they seem pretty durable and well made but I have only used them on a couple of quick projects.

**Cables** 

The set comes with 4 purple nylon cables. The website lists them as two 24 inch cables, one 32 inch cable, and one 40 inch cable, but this includes the length of the needles. The actual size is two 15 inch cables, one 22 inch cable, and one 29.5 inch cable. The cables were very stiff at first but did seem to become more relaxed as I used them.

There is a 1.5 inch cable connector provided as well which allows you to join two cables together to make a longer cable. There''s only one cable connector, which I find a little disappointing. It would be nice to be able to join more than one cable if needed or to have a spare in case you lose it since its pretty small.

They provide two cable keys that you use to tighten the needles to cables and cables to the connector. If you try to hand tighten them, they will loosen while you''re knitting so you need to use the key. They are a decent wire gauge and feel pretty sturdy. I wish there was a key ring or something to put them on because I feel like they''ll be easy to lose but they are pretty standard. The join between the needles and cable is very smooth with no catching on the yarn and I had no issues with them loosening as I knitted.

**Accessories** 

The set comes in a 9" x 5" clear snapped vinyl needle case. This is just a cheap plastic case with snaps, kind of like you''d get with a set of cheap markers. The flap broke the minute I opened it so don''t count on using that as storage.

There are 8 end caps provided. You can take your needles off the cable and replace it with an end cap to hold your work on the cable and then use your needles for something else. I imagine you could also use it to create a "flat" knitting needle using a cable and a needle but I''m not sure why you''d do that vs knitting with the two circulars attached.

I haven''t used them yet because I prefer to leave my project on the needles and use rubber needle caps but its nice to have them. If you''re someone who likes to work on a variety of projects at once on the same size needles, they will be a big help for you.

**Pros and Cons**

IMO the biggest perk of buying into a "premium" set like this is the ability to buy additional/replacement parts and different size needles. There are options from US 4 (3.5 mm) through US 17 (12mm) available in different colors and materials. There are also shorter needles (2.75 inches) which can make it easier to knit smaller circles.

You can buy different length cables as well, from 16 inches to 60 inches (from needle tip to tip, they don''t provide the actual cable length) and they come with their own cable key and end caps which is nice. You can also buy additional cable connectors.
