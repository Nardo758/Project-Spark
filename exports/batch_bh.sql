**3. Timers & guide fixes**

- **1v1 Arena** timer updated to the new “22:00 → 20:00 next day (UTC)” window.
- Trading week & price-check timers cleaned up.
- **Multi-Day One-Time Rewards:** the **Well of Heaven** section was rewritten to explain the **Slogan Snatches** route instead of the old co-op flow.

## What’s next (no ETA)

No promises on dates, but the main idea I want to tackle next is:

- A **“what you should / could be buying” helper**: daily / weekly / monthly / one-off purchase suggestions so you can quickly see which vendors/currencies are worth spending on and what’s safe to skip.

I might also refactor some UI bits when I have time, but there’s no timeline for that.
