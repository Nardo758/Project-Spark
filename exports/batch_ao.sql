Should I just build a proper NextJS SaaS boilerplate for myself or keep suffering?

I started packaging my reusable code. Supabase auth, Stripe integration, Replicate API setup, admin panel. The boring NextJS SaaS boilerplate stuff everyone rebuilds.

But I see a dozen NextJS SaaS boilerplate repos online. Most are either incomplete tutorials or $300 packages with features I don''t need.

**For people who''ve launched multiple SaaS products:**

* Do you use a NextJS SaaS boilerplate or start from scratch?
* Does a focused NextJS SaaS boilerplate for AI tools even make sense?
* Or is rebuilding infrastructure just part of the process?

Specifically asking about NextJS + Replicate API integration but curious about any stack.

I''m cleaning up my code into a reusable NextJS SaaS boilerplate. Thinking of sharing it but want to know if other founders actually need this or if it''s just me being inefficient.

apologies for the long post in advance. for context: i am diagnosed with bpd and it has been a problem in my relationships for years. this year back in october, i finally got access to dbt therapy and have been trying to continue with it despite feeling hopeless. i have not been able to renew my medication, but in a couple days i should be able to connect with my doctor to get everything represcribed.

i have a boyfriend, we have been together for a year now. my bpd keeps getting in the way of our ability to problem solve together. every single time i feel threatened, confused, scared, and so on, my mind immediately goes to perceiving him as the aggressor who is purposefully not understanding me to cause me further harm. that in turn makes me aggressive and hostile. ive never physically hurt him, but to remain on “top” of the argument and not lose control, i will spiral and continue the fight until we are both raging and angry and exhausted. i am so sick of myself and because of my therapy only being twice a week (one day is for a zoom group meeting and the other is for an in person 1 on 1 meeting), it hasnt been that helpful yet. i am hoping that getting back on medication (mood stabilizers, anti depressants) will help me a little but with how bad everything has been, i feel hopeless. we are arguing constantly because he will do something i get triggered by, i will flare up, and i wont be able to stop in time. he hurts me on occasion too but apologizes. but the arguments have been so frequent that we both have to extract apologies from each other because he thinks im in the wrong i think hes in the wrong. HOW DO I SEE MYSELF IN THE WRONG? its so so insanely difficult to actually understand what im doing wrong most times and even though it comes to me eventually and i apologize, the fact that i am not able to immediately recognize it before the argument starts is what leads to us arguing. i am so sick of myself and hate that this is who i am. i just want to be normal. i want some kind of fool proof method that i can easily rely on before i start spiralling out of control. nothing seems to work, i cant bring myself back to my body in the split second that i have between “oh no” and “complete rage self sabotage destroy everything” modes.

do not suggest breaking up, neither of us want that. i want to know how to change efficiently. i want to know what i can do to prevent myself from repeatedly falling back into those patterns that only worsen the situation. something fast that can snap me out of it and give me enough time to step away and think.
