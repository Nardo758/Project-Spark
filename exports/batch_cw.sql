**Some lifehacks:**

**Layering effects:** You can stack multiple effects on a single clip, and Movavi handles it surprisingly well. Just add one, then drag another, but don’t go overboard or you’ll turn your video into a visual panic attack.

**Keyframe animation:** Want your effect to slide in or intensify over time? Use the Animation - Advanced - Add keyframe feature (can be found in more tools on the toolbar). Took me a hot minute to figure out, but it’s awesome for things like zoom-ins or fade-outs with a blur.

**Custom filters:** You can also mess with adjustments manually (brightness, contrast, saturation) then save that combo as a custom preset. It’s not quite an “effect,” but it lets you make your own vibey filter.

**Import your own overlays:** If you don’t want to pay for the crown effects, you can import transparent overlays (like fire, sparkles, VHS static) from free stock video sites and layer them over your video. 

**Some issues I’ve run into:**

* Occasionally, effects can lag in preview mode. Especially if you’re stacking 3+ filters. I usually switch preview to low resolution to fix that.
* If you export in lower resolution, some effects look kinda meh or pixelated. Stick to 1080p minimum if you''re adding any detailed visuals.
* Some effects reset randomly when you cut a clip. If that happens, just re-drag the effect onto the new clip.

Here''s my quick breakdown:\n\n**The basic method:**\n\n* Open Movavi Video Editor and drag and drop your clips onto the timeline.\n* Hit the Effects tab on the left sidebar (looks like a magic wand emoji’s cousin).\n* Scroll through categories: “Artistic,” “Flying Objects,” “Retro,” etc. There’s a LOT, and half of them are lowkey wild.\n* Drag and drop the effect onto the clip, and that’s basically it.\n\nBUT here''s the catch:\n\nSome of those juicy overlay effects are paywalled (I know, it sucks). They’re marked with a small crown. If you’re using the free version, clicking on them gives you a passive-aggressive “upgrade now” pop-up, which is also annoying. And if you decide to add them anyway, the video will export with a watermark.\n\n**Some lifehacks:**\n\n**Layering effects:** You can stack multiple effects on a single clip, and Movavi handles it surprisingly well.

So I am aware that my engine runs on 2 cylinders which I made a post about and I believed it to be 4 & 3 due to pulling the leads to 1&2 while it''s running and no change, standard stuff.

 So did a service and replaced ignition parts up to the ignitor, put new fuel n filter in, checked timing marks, cleaned air filter, removed tested and cleaned injectors.
 I reached the point where compression was the last thing to check, however the results threw me. 

Cylinder 1 - 0 psi (non running)
Cylinder 2 - 175psi (non running)
Cylinder 3 - 165psi (running)
Cylinder 4 - 0 psi (running?)

So first I thought I''d done it wrong so I got a friend and we tested multiple times but couldn''t get a reading from cylinders 1 &4 which I found very odd considering cylinder 4 runs well.
On top of that cylinder 2 makes good compression but I can''t get that thing to fire.
To add, the spark plugs for 4&3 are black with carbon where as 1&2 are clean. 
I should say I have changed most things you would change when a car doesn''t run right and it hasn''t fixed her.

So being lost and confused I thought I''d ask the mechanics and group experts out there as Iv reached the end of my knowledge. She must be saved being almost rust free from what I can tell. And yes the battery is a bit weak atm.

I''m excited to announce that [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) v4.0.0 is coming very soon. We will release v4.0.0 at the beginning of next year - in just a couple of weeks time. For now, v4.0.0-rc.8 has been released to all channels.

## What is Kreuzberg?

Kreuzberg is a document intelligence toolkit for extracting text, metadata, tables, images, and structured data from 56+ file formats. It was originally written in Python (v1-v3), where it demonstrated strong performance characteristics compared to alternatives in the ecosystem.

## What''s new in V4?
