She diagnosed somebody with Borderline PD and the person was the farthest thing from it, as well as reported a client with HI/SI and recommended Baker Acting them. Thorough investigation by my bosses and transfer of client to a more seasoned therapist revealed that was not the case. And as an aside, that client is still doing ok, a month later. 

Our supervisor can be very firm and terse when it comes to client health and patient respect, and Lisa didn’t like it, insisting she was being bullied, and she quietly packed up her things one night after my boss left and quit without notice.

This time around my partner and I visited Chicago in the first week of November. We decided to stay 3 nights at the Four Seasons and since our flight got cancelled we stayed 1 night at the Pendry.

**Four Seasons**

We were able to check in around 8am and have notified the hotel that it was our first time in Chicago and that it was our anniversary.

*Room*: I booked a lake view king room but got upgraded to a city-view executive suite. The view was nice and the extra sq footage was appreciated. I do think one of the biggest gripes about this Four Seasons is that the room looks a little too corporate. It''s clean and nice, but I wish it had a bit more personality. The shower was also shockingly small and I wish there was a double vanity instead of just one sink.

*Breakfast*: Breakfast here was pretty good, and the portions are huge! Our waitress was very friendly and nice. The prices are also predictably high however and after tip we went over our limit quite fast.

*Property Credit*: $100 that could be used towards dining or spa. We had a couples spa but the credit already went to covering breakfast at this point.

*Misc*: The hotel was kind enough to send up chocolate strawberries and a bottle of champagne to the room (I''m assuming because it was our anniversary). No note though.

This was my first time staying in a Four Seasons and although it was very nice, I can''t help but think maybe my expectations were too high, especially for the price point. There were a couple of things that occurred that I thought was odd for a 5 star hotel. For example, when we were escorted to our room they made it a point to say that water is refilled every time housekeeping comes in. The entire time we were there that did not happen. We had to request for water multiple times or take some bottled ones from the lobby. When they clean the bathroom, they did not restock items that could''ve been restocked (like the bath salts or bar soap). Some clothing items fell to the floor (while they''re redoing sheets I imagine) and were left there. These are probably nitpicks and ultimately not the biggest deal but thought I should point them out. 

It''s not all doom and gloom as I thought the staff were all super warm and welcoming and the view from the room really was great (especially when it was snowing). They accommodated us with our own fridge (not allowed to use the in-room one) and our own microwave. We also were able to do their Handshake speakeasy pop up and thought that was a really great experience. 

**Pendry**

Due to our flight being cancelled I just booked whatever hotel was available and on the cheaper side, and the Pendry fell in that category. 

*Room*: I booked a base King guestroom and they upgraded us to a corner room that had a clear view of the river and Marina City which I appreciated. The room was simple but still quite nice/clean and the bathroom was decently large, although it had no bath tub. 

*Breakfast*: The hotel partners with Venteux, the cafe next door, for breakfast. And all I''m gonna say is: get the duck&waffle. This dish was so good that my partner and I would come back just for it.

*Property Credit*: We decided to use our $100 credit at the bar near the lobby. It seems like a popular place as seemingly non-guests often come in to just drink/hang out. According to my partner, the lemon drops they made her were the best she''s had.

This was my first time staying at a Pendry as well and it''s clear why this particular Pendry often have rates that are 50%+ cheaper than their fellow FHR mates. It''s simply not on the same caliber of luxury as those hotels. However, if you don''t need all the bells and whistles of a 5* hotel, it''s still a very nice place to stay. I think it has great value and the location is pristine. Short walk from the river and to cloud gate.

Overall, great stays at both hotels. I did wish they were more generous with their breakfast as every single cent that went over the $60 threshold was charged and yet I''ve stayed at other FHRs where they would waive off anything extra completely. The next time I''m in the city, I''ll be sure to checkout the Langham as I''ve heard really good things.
