At Camwood, we''ve been managing enterprise endpoints for years. We thought we''d seen every patching scenario. Then last month happened.

The Setup

4:47pm Friday. Collaboration software announces zero-day. CVSS 9.8. Active exploitation in the wild. Exploit code public within 6 hours.

8,000 endpoints. Global organisation. 24/7 operations across three continents.

Vendor patch available by 5:30pm. Our inbox: 47 escalation emails. CIO, CISO, regional directors—everyone suddenly very interested in patch management.

The Problem

Traditional playbook says: Test thoroughly before deploying. Sensible advice that would leave the organisation exposed for days.

Alternative playbook says: Deploy everywhere immediately. Absolutely terrible advice that could disable 8,000 systems simultaneously if there''s a config conflict.

Our team was sitting there thinking: These are both bad options. There has to be a better way.

What Actually Happened

We''d recently implemented intelligent phased deployment with automated validation. Initially, there was some scepticism internally—it seemed like over-engineering.

Friday 6:15pm: Deployed to pilot group of 100 systems. Automated health checks every 15 minutes. Application launches, connectivity tests, performance baselines—all automated.

7:00pm: Pilot group green. System automatically deployed to next wave of 500.

8:15pm: 2,000 critical systems protected. Still zero incidents.

11:30pm: All 8,000 endpoints patched and validated.

Monday morning: CEO asks if the organisation is protected. Answer: Yes, since Friday night.

What We Learned

We''d been thinking about patch automation wrong. The assumption was that automation meant "faster deployment." But that''s not the real value.

The real value is automated validation at scale.
