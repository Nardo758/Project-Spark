See specs below for a bit more detail.\n\n\n\nWe re-foamed the woofers and cleaned up the cabinets ensuring another 20 years of happy enjoyment in their new home.\n\n\n\nYou will be amazed by the amount of bass this moderately sized speaker can produce.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Acoustic Research, Circa 1977:\n\nThe Acoustic Research 10\u03c0 is a new speaker system from Acoustic Research that addresses itself to these considerations. Under\nactual listening conditions, the AR-10\u03c0 delivers as flat an energy response as the state of the art permits. And it is able to\nmaintain this response characteristic under a great variety of conditions of use. The result is a further significant improvement\nin the degree of realism with which music can be heard in the home.\n\n\n\nThe AR-10\u03c0 - is designed to reproduce music in the home as accurately as the state of the art permits. Its ability in this respect\nrepresents a number of significant evolutionary improvements over previous designs. Further the AR-10\u03c0 - is intended to offer an\nunprecedented degree of flexibility without any sacrifice in accuracy. The combination of these characteristic, we believe,\nrepresents a significant step forward in loudspeaker design.\n\n\n\nThe AR 10\u03c0 is a no-compromise 3 way speaker system with excellent dispersion and even energy output all across the audible\nspectrum. A pair of 3 position switches allows the owner to adjust the mid and high-range drivers to the \"liveliness\" of the room\nwhile the 3-position woofer environmental control allows the owner to adjust the low-end response to speaker placement. This\nallows the owner to place the speakers on the center of the wall, on the floor against the wall or away from the wall.\n\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nDrive units:\n\nLow-Frequency:\n\n300 mm (12 in.) acoustic suspension woofer\n\n\n\nMid-Frequency:\n\n38 mm (1-1/2 in.) hemispherical dome midrange\n\n\n\nHigh-Frequency:\n\n19 mm (3/4 in.) hemispherical dome highrange\n\n\n\nCrossover Frequencies:\n\n525 Hz, 5000 Hz\n\n\n\nFrequency Range:\n\n27 Hz - 30 kHz\n\n\n\nImpedance:\n\n4\u03a9 - 8\u03a9\n\n\n\nSensitivity:\n\n9 watts\n\n\n\nControls:\n\nThree 3-position switches for woofer environmental control and for midrange and highrange level control\n\n\n\nImpedance:\n\n4 to 8\u03a9 nominal, depending on switch positions, highest impedance in \u03c0 and -6 dB switch positions, lowest in 4\u03c0 and 0db\n\n\n\nEfficiency:\n\n1 watt will produce 86 dB SPL on axis at 1 meter\n\n\n\nAmplifier Power Requirement:\n\n25 watts (into one speaker only) will produce 100 dB SPL in a 3000 cu \u03c0 room of average reflectivity (energy absorption\ncoefficient of 0,15), 50 watts (25 watts per channel) will produce 103 dB SPL in the same room\n\n\n\nPower Handling Ability:\n\nMay be used with amplifiers capable of delivering up to 150 watts continuous power per channel being driven to clipping 10 % of\nthe time, on normal music material source\n\n\n\nNominal Power Handing:\n\n100 watts (max, 250)\n\n\n\nCrossover Network:\n\nHalf-section LC network on each driver using air-core chokes and computer grade bi-polar electrolytic capacitors.

Sperm banks and fertility clinics must recruit, screen, and compensate donors to meet the growing demand from infertile couples, same-sex couples, and single individuals seeking assisted reproductive services. This opportunity addresses the recruitment and retention challenge within the sperm donation ecosystem, where financial incentives serve as a primary mechanism to attract qualified candidates through rigorous medical and genetic screening processes. The global assisted reproductive technology (ART) market continues to expand as awareness increases and treatment costs decrease, creating sustained demand for donor gametes.', 'Healthcare', 'Reproductive Medicine / Fertility Services', 3, 0, 0.0, NULL, 'national', 'United States', 'Varies by clinic location', 'Multiple metropolitan areas', 'open', NULL, NULL, NULL, 65.0, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 'active', '2025-12-22 01:33:26.308190+00:00', NULL, '7903630566', 'https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/lbg/d/san-francisco-get-paid-up-to-1000-for/7903630566.html', 'craigslist', TRUE, '2025-12-22 01:33:52.519570', 55, 'Recruit and compensate qualified sperm donors to supply fertility clinics addressing unmet demand in assisted reproductive services.', '$2.5B-$4.2B', 'medium', 'medium', 'Sperm banks, fertility clinics, reproductive endocrinology practices, and infertility treatment centers', 6, '["Sperm bank operator with donor recruitment and compensation management", "Donor recruitment agency providing qualified candidates to fertility clinics on commission basis", "Technology platform connecting donors with clinics and managing screening/compensation workflows"]', NULL, '["Highly regulated industry requiring FDA compliance, state licensing, and rigorous donor screening protocols", "Significant liability exposure related to genetic screening, disease transmission, and identity/custody issues", "Ethical and social considerations around commodification of reproductive material and long-term donor tracking for offspring health"]', '["Research existing sperm bank operations and regulatory requirements (FDA guidance, state reproductive tissue laws)", "Interview 10-15 fertility clinic directors to quantify donor shortage severity and willingness to pay for recruitment services", "Analyze competitor sperm banks (Fairfax Cryobank, California Cryobank, etc.) to identify service gaps and market positioning opportunities"]', NULL, 'Sperm banks and fertility clinics struggle to maintain adequate inventory of donor sperm to meet patient demand.
