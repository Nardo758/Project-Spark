Cons:

* The tech isn''t fine-tuned. I was upset with my 508, but this is even worse for some things. Not something that can abort the sale, mind me, but it does feel like the developers never actually drove the prototype. 
   * The dashboard doesn''t correctly switch to night view, sometimes, and it''s not exactly fast to find the setting in the dashboard. This is quite annoying
   * The headlamps don''t auto-beam, like others mentioned. It''s a frustration after getting used to it
      UPDATE: After driving without this feature I actually prefer not to have it. I could see the past 2 nights how difficult it is to drive at night. Not because of the road or what, I actually enjoy driving in the dark and in the rain. It''s because of other car''s auto beam lights! And so powerful! I am a supporter of a regulation in this sense, but not having this feature has already improved things a lot. I noted how I was turning the lights up when I needed and was safe to do, rather than others blinding me all the time. Yeah I''m against it now. 
   * Too distracting to navigate menus while driving. They should have gone for some physical switches, they wouldn''t have ruined the aesthetic!!
   * The wireless charger would benefit for a magnetic holder or a frame. The phone slides down and stops charging (I have a samsung s22plus, for reference)
   * My android auto doesn''t auto connect. I have to switch on the bluetooth in my phone each time. It might be the phone, but I have another wireless android auto (also chinese, on the motorbike) and that works no problem. 
      NOTE; This seems to be random. Today it auto connected fine. 
   * The android auto keeps disconnecting every 5 mins approx. This is super-super annoying. It auto reconnects, but you lose 20 something seconds, which might make a difference while navigating. Again, could be the phone, but no problems with the other wireless android auto
      NOTE: I think this is because my wife''s iPhone (which has also been paired to the car) is in the car as well. It might be trying to connect. I''ll report back the next time I do a trip alone.

I drive the car almost daily, so come back for updates! \n\n\nI am going to \"own\" the MG IM5 Standard Range for the next 3 years.\n\nI have got the car for a few days, did some miles on it trying all the things, and I can release a first review, someone asked for it so here it is!\n\nBackground:  \nTech Savvy male in early forties, used to cars since 18 and before. Owned AlfaRomeo, BMW, Renault, Peugeot, Mercedes, Nissan, Ford, Opel/Vauxhall, Toyota... and some.\n\nThis is my first EV after a 2021 Peugeot 508 2.0 Diesel. I was considering a Jaecoo J7, so I will do a bit of comparison in this review. \n\nPros:\n\n* The car is indeed beautiful. \n* Sporty enough for the intended audience\n   * It''s quick. Boy it is quick.\n* Lots and lots of tech\n* Mileage is discreet, but change the range type to DMRS (or something like that) to have a more real estimate of the remaining range\n* Cornering is dope. The rear steering wheels are incredible, every car should have them (was the same with my old Nissan Fairlady back in the early 2000s)\n* The cameras are real good quality, nothing close to my old 508!\n   * But the rear manouvering one still gets dirt due to the position\n   * The \"rear mirror\" one it''s always good because it''s on the fin on the roof\n* Overall it''s really well built. Can''t fault anything\n* I don''t miss the central rear mirror. The camera is really good\n* Speakers are quite nice. Initially I thought they sounded worse than the cardboard speakers in my 508 (which are actually quite good), but it was just about finding the right settings. They don''t like to play loud, though. \n* The 360 camera, albeit not as good as the Jaecoo''s, does a real good job. \n* Trunk space is good enough, but being this kind of a coupe, it''s low. Not as low as my 508, though. You can load plenty\n* Despite being only a few cms longer than my 508 it is is way more spacious. The rear seats are so far! :D \n* The crab walking is quite good! I thought it was a gimmick, and perhaps it is, but it turned out helpful a couple times\n* The autoparking feature is quite aggressive, but doesn''t miss a shot. Perfect and fast parking all the time\n* The embedded sim card has real strong signal. Even when my phone doesn''t have reception, this one''s really good. \n* The tech feels more european than the Jaecoo. Even though it''s required, there''s a fast way to disable all the ADAS in (almost) one button. \n   * I mean to say, it doesn''t scream chinese car like the Jaecoo does. It feels more european in this sense.\n* Despite not having matrix light, the illumination at night is really good. So good I''m afraid it blinds other drivers, but noone beamed so far, so I guess it''s good.\n* Can''t obviously comment on the photo-cromatic sunroof just yet, since we''ve got no sun in the Cotswolds, but \"it seems ok\" :D \n\n  \nCons:\n\n* The tech isn''t fine-tuned.

If you’re the type who:

* enjoys **building a roster over seasons**
* likes experimenting with positions and player roles
* actually cares about progression, cap decisions, and long-term team identity
* gets bored playing the same “correct” way every league



…then you’re probably in the wrong leagues.



**miniFL** is an 8-user, adult sim league built around the *team-building loop*.

Light rules. Honor system. Freedom to build your team your way — in exchange for balanced, non-lobby gameplay (no Bunch/Tight spam).



We’re in **Season 5**, and the league has developed real continuity — teams, storylines, and reputations that carry over year to year.
