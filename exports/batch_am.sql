The bar is much lower than I could have ever imagined.', 'In my last few jobs, I became responsible for screening applicants for the first time. And honestly, from what I''ve seen, I''m no longer surprised why so many people struggle just to get an interview. Sometimes it''s just a difficult numbers game; some jobs get over a thousand applications even after we filter out the completely irrelevant ones.

We''ve all seen the complaint posts from job seekers, and I myself was in their shoes one day. But let me give you a small glimpse from the other side. Sure, part of the problem is with the job applications themselves, but an incredibly larger part is the complete lack of the most basic soft skills.

I''m sure there''s more to it, but this is just a list of things that happened just last week that really annoyed me.

We can disagree and discuss any of these points, and it would be a real and useful discussion if we could avoid just downvoting things we don''t agree with.

Here is a list of the strange things - in no particular order - that I''ve encountered while trying to hire for junior positions:

First and foremost, because this is very basic: answer your phone like a normal human being. Seriously. Just say "Hello." The number of people who answer the call and remain completely silent is baffling. I don''t understand this behavior in everyday life, let alone when you''re actively job hunting. You''re just hurting yourself. What''s the point? If you''re checking if the number is spam, it''s better not to answer at all. If it''s not a good time, just say so. A silent answer from any applicant is an immediate rejection for me. I won''t call them again.

CV formatting. I''ve seen some weird stuff shared on Reddit, but that''s nothing compared to what I get in my inbox. It''s a mess of fonts, colors, and weird spacing, with no alignment, and blocks of text crammed together that are impossible to read. Nobody is asking for a graphic designer''s masterpiece, but honestly, the look of some of these CVs suggests it took more effort to make them than if they had just used a simple, clean design like the ones most word processors give by default.

CV content. Oh my god. I understand that some people don''t have much experience and need to "pad" it a bit, but please, use your brain. I don''t need a four-paragraph essay about your duties as a cashier at Carrefour, for example. Be concise, focus on conveying your transferable skills or your ambition. And for the love of God, check your spelling. Have a friend review it, especially if grammar isn''t your strong suit.

Outright rudeness. Just this morning, three people sighed and huffed loudly while I was trying to confirm very basic information with them. And some people were mumbling while talking to me. I don''t care what kind of day you''re having; if you''re rude to me on the phone, your application will be rejected immediately. Just today, I spoke to eight people who gave one-word answers and ignored direct questions. At least pretend to be interested. If you''re no longer interested or it''s not a good time, say so!

Trying to have an important call on speakerphone. Look, I know this might vary depending on where you are, but no one wants to have an important call while hearing the TV, your kids, and street noise in the background. Again, if it''s not a good time, postpone the call. It''s not a big deal.

Having no idea what job you applied for. This one truly baffles me. I assume these are people who just apply to anything to prove they''re looking for work and collect unemployment benefits. I''m not talking about needing a quick reminder - that happens to all of us. I''m talking about people who, even after I re-explain the job and the company, still have absolutely no clue.

Unprofessional voicemails. Some of them are honestly funny, but others are just very weird. Use your head. You can change your voicemail to something normal for a few weeks while you''re job hunting.

Your email address. We''re approaching mid-2025, and I can''t believe we still need to say this. They taught us this in school 15 years ago. Don''t use a silly-looking email. An email like stoner\_dave\_420 isn''t going to help you. Create a separate, professional-looking email specifically for your job search.

  
Lastly, this might be a hot take, but use AI if you need to. Don’t rely on it entirely, just to polish your resume or cover letter. Avoid Chat GPT, there are now tools specific to every task. I use [this on](https://resumekit.interviewhammer.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=InterviewsHell&utm_term=ma&utm_content=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FInterviewsHell%2Fcomments%2F1ojxzoy%2Fmy_first_experience_as_a_hiring_manager_opened_my%2F)e to polish my resume. It is very helpful. Using AI is about writing the right prompt. Keep trying until you find the result you want.

And I’ve kind of understood that this is his opinion, and that’s okay to have that opinion. I’ve cut off all my male friends because he said so. I only have one left, and I’ve known him since we were kids, so I don’t want to cut him off. He was fine with that — or at least I thought so — because now he’s sending me reels about exactly this, like “girls who say they won’t cut off their best friend,” and then it shows a man punching a wall really hard… like wtf?

He also has a childhood female friend and doesn’t want to cut her off either, because he’s known her since they were little. I don’t want to ask him to cut her off either, because they’ve been friends for so long, and I don’t want to be the girlfriend who says, “you’re not allowed to see this or that person.”

I’ve told him that he doesn’t need to send me all these reels anymore, because I get his point and I understand that other men feel the same way he does. Every single time he sends those videos, I feel like I’m the bad guy in this relationship… it makes me physically sick and gives me a lot of anxiety.
