Factory- Royal Factory 

So im wearing this baby today .... tbh when I like something I will get it in all colors ... thats just me ... ive always been this way 🙈

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️


My experience with the seller

So what i did was hit up all the sellers that i wanted to try out( pretty much all the sellers that my friends have tried with successful transactions) . Some didnt work out and then others clearly did. Marku is one that worked out . He is very direct and real quick with psps . Mine only took two days to get to me and i liked his shipping method. His packaging was really good , the bag wasn''t smashed.  He seems familiar with factories as well , so thats a plus . I feel like as ling as the sellers can source where I like and their prices are all around the sale range then you are all good in my book .

All this to tell that

“Love is the most twisted curse of all”

Kira Sanchez Alexander I was a good kid, at least I thought so. I’m not completely sure if I ever was one. All I know is that I''ve changed, and not for the better. People used to tell me how I acted so much differently as a child, how I was happy, excited, brave, intelligent, and nice. Now all I am is depressed so as the therapist says. When people tell me how I used to be it really shows me how I''m not how I used to be. How i''m not ever happy, nice, or even smart. They might as well tell it to me directly instead of talking about me to everyone and acting like I’m going to break if they even so much as look at me wrong. My mother and father act and talk to me like some child. Then when I express myself and how I truly feel, I''m shoved away, instead they talk of themselves, how their lives were so much harder therefore I shouldn''t be sad since they''re trying to make my life better then theirs. I should be happy. I should, but I can''t. All I am right now is a hollow of who I used to be. How I used to want to fly, and now all I want to do is stay on land, too afraid of what might happen if I try to do anything.

My father is a strong man, from being stuck in the mud from now having the life he and his mother have always wanted, as well as an immigrant can get to at least. Now he owns a drywall company getting money that he uses like he’ll never run out. My mom wasn''t so lucky. Her parents were never around much, so naturally she became rebellious, in trouble, a juvenile delinquent with charges even grown up. She''s had to fight for everything even to this day. I admire her, yet I don''t want to end up like her, she''s had problems and has had to be in not so legal jobs just to pass by.

My father would pay rent, then he would threaten to not pay it when my mother and him were in arguments. My father is not a person who will ever really be there for me, he might for financial reasons, yet never emotionally. My mother can be both, she listens and understands me like no one else, even when broke she still finds ways to get me what I want even when I don’t need it. My father doesn’t help my mother even now, when she is at her lowest. Every day all I wish to do in life is to make sure she will live comfortably without having to worry about money. Right now she’s not allowed to have us until she gets a stable living situation, but I miss her everyday, all I want to do is be with her more than anything else. The last time I saw her was the day I laid back and realized everything. The only way to not suffer this, the feeling of nothingness, dread, and disappointment anymore was to let everything go. I know what I have to do, I’m just scared to.

I need something else, I need a release that I can have. I wish I were a toy, just so I could always be happy, laugh, smile, and have no ideals or nothingness. I could be free and someone would want me. I need something. To help me feel better. Not some stupid pills to make me “act better” all they''ve done is make me feel crazy. I need something that actually affects me. That makes me feel alive, that can erase my mind from everything I’ve ever known. Right now I only have 2 choices. chug or inhale. I preferably choose both paths.
