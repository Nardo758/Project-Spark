I don’t want to do anything that brings needless attention to me, but for some reason every girl around me needs to make a point to remind me about how I should wear super tall heels and “work it” all the time, again, like I have to prove to the world that tall women and be this and that. Why do I have to that? Also, heels are mad uncomfortable - to me, not ever having a need nor desire to wear this is a privilege.

Can’t they just believe that if a tall girl wants to date a short guy, she will? Why must I prove it?

Can’t they just believe that if a tall girl wants to wear tall heels, she will? Why must I prove it?

Why do people expect me to fetishize my own height?

Why do people act like I’m ashamed of my height and expect me to overcompensate. Why does everything I do need to be a grandiose act of acceptance?

It’s frustrating that my height (and let’s be real, race) ranks above my well established personality when it comes to how my closest friends will perceive me sometimes. Maybe I need more tall and/or black friends lolol, but at my uni there are not many black people near nor tall girls.

Does anyone else hate being expected to be the counterexample to the female experience?\n\nIm 21, in my final year of college. I’m 5’10.5, so I’m not even really that tall. But, I’m taller than every girl I know and quite a lot of men. I’m fine with that, and honestly I like being tall! If it weren’t for the people being annoying and finding pants, I really wouldn’t have a single complaint. It gives me a lot of free aura. but I’m tired of three things:\n\n1. Expected to be dominant “mommy” “tree to climb”\n2. Expected to happily date shorter\n3. Expected to “rock my height” wherever I go.\n\nFor context, I’m also black and naturally retain muscle pretty easily, so I’m pretty strong too. But people treat me like I’m this super aggressive “put men in their place” figure. I wouldn’t say that’s the case - I’m not traditional by any means and I’m pretty career oriented, but I think that’s the norm for women nowadays. And somehow, not being a tradwife + being tall means im a dominitrix. And my friends always want me to consider people who are shorter than me or men they perceive as submissive. It’s always something along these lines:\n\n“You can show the world that there’s nothing wrong with it!” \n\n“There’s nothing wrong with that right? 5’8 is fine though, cmon”\n\n🔁 translating 🔁\n\n“You are reminding us about the problematic standards we live by. seeing as you’re an edge case application, you need to bear the burden of breaking that standard to make as us feel like better people”\n\nWhy is that MY problem? These girls could also date men shorter than them and show the world, but they don’t want to. So they just export that burden to their nearest tall friend. I don’t want to be in a relationship that continues to permeate the idea that I’m this aggressive figure. It’s so frustrating that I told them to stop trying to set me up with people if they aren’t actually going to listen to me.\n\nAnd I’m also super inexperienced - I’ve never had sex with, dated, kissed, or even held hands with a guy before. So, I think another part of why this upsets me so much is because I feel like I’m getting an undertone of “you’re not good enough for what you want - and that’s been made clear by you’re lack of history, so, you have to accept fringe / niche relationship types bc those ppl (guys who can’t pull a woman their height or guys with a tall girl fetish) are the only ones who would consider you”\n\nOn top of that, I’m DONT LIKE ATTENTION.

For the longest time, I assumed I was “doing customer discovery” by checking Subreddit, Hacker News, and niche forums every day.

But if I’m being honest, it felt more like guesswork:

* Scrolling for the right keywords
* Jumping between posts
* Catching the perfect thread… hours after the conversation died
* Feeling like I was always late to help anyone

And the worst part ?

I kept wondering how many conversations I *never* even saw.

Eventually I hit a point where I thought:

*"There has to be a better way to find people who actually need what I’m building, right when they need it."*

So I built **[Leadlee](http://www.leadlee.co)**.

It’s super simple, but it pretty much solved the problem for me:

* **It monitors the communities** where my potential customers hang out
* **It cuts the noise**, only surfacing posts where someone has a real need
* **It notifies me instantly**, so I can jump into the conversation while it''s still alive - not after it''s frozen over
