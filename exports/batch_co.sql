Here are 6 insights any creator can learn from", "original_body" : "Pinch Of Yum went from a fourth-grade teacher’s weekend side hustle to a $100K+/month food content empire.\n\nTheir business model in **3 steps**:\n\n1. Generate traffic from Google SEO, Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram.\n2. Build trust through community-building and a relatable content style.\n3. Turn traffic into revenue through ads, affiliate revenue, sponsorships, and a membership site.\n\nI spent 8 hours digging into the content across their blog and social media channels.\n\nHere are 6 easy-to-implement strategies/techniques Lindsay Ostrom uses to get more clicks, engagement, and revenue.\n\n# 🚀 Traffic (Get More Clicks)\n\n**1. Promise Simplicity**\n\n3 of their most popular blog posts (according to Ubersuggest):\n\n*Quick Homemade Ramen Recipe*\n\n*The Best Easy Pasta Salad Recipe*\n\n*15 Minute Lo Mein Recipe*\n\nNotice a pattern?\n\nPinch Of Yum promises **ease** and **quickness** with a lot of their headlines and titles.\n\nThey know what people want.\n\n*Takeaway*:\n\nAttention spans are short and the average person doesn’t have time for a 3-hour masterclass.\n\nPromising simplicity and speed in headlines and titles is often a winner and increases click-through rate.\n\n**2. Drop Them In The Action**\n\nYou’ll notice that a lot of their Instagram Reels start with the “peak” and then transition to the beginning of the recipe.\n\nYou’ve got a few seconds to hook the audience before they scroll down, swipe away, or exit.\n\nThis is especially true when you''re competing for clicks on a newsfeed.\n\nIf you start with the empty pan, you’re unlikely to grab their attention.\n\nBut start with a quick shot of a beautiful, steaming, creamy bowl of pasta - they’re sticking around to see how to make it.\n\n*Takeaway*:\n\nWhen it comes to \"how-to” content (whether it''s a blog post, long-form, or short-form video), consider using the payoff (i.e. what they’re going to make/build/learn) as the hook.\n\nThis way, the audience immediately knows whether it’s worth their time to stick around.\n\n# 💖 Building Trust (Make Them Stick)\n\n**3. Show Your Appreciation**\n\nLindsay often shows her appreciation for her audience.\n\nEvery Friday, she spotlights her community’s dishes with the “Reader Awards” on Instagram stories.\n\nShe celebrates her followers and their success. It drives a sense of belonging and community. It turns her audience from passive consumers of her content into active contributors.\n\nShe also often mentions how much she appreciates her audience allowing her to do what she does for a living.\n\n💡 *Content Psychology Tip:* Lindsay showing appreciation is an act of giving → followers are more likely to return the favor through engagement and loyalty \\~ Reciprocity Bias\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Talk Like A Human**\n\nIt’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to impress our audience with fancy words. But Lindsay (and her success) shows us why this is unnecessary (and off-putting).\n\nCheck out this excerpt from her recipe for lentil soup as an example:\n\n*\"I see you, hungry reader whose life is crazy right now, who has a hard time finding the time to cook even though you love food, who opens the fridge to grab a quick lunch to take to work in the morning rush only to find NOTHING that seems good enough, who values the big bowl of comfort food pasta above all else, who is not asking for much other than GOOD FOOD that is made for REAL LIFE.\"*\n\nIt’s almost as if she’s joking around with us through the screen.\n\nIt puts us at ease and lets us know this isn’t going to be a dry lecture.\n\nIt also lets us know there’s a human being behind the content and not an AI chatbot.\n\n💡 *Content Psychology Tip*: We are more likely to engage with people who we like and can relate to. While this seems obvious in real life, creators often ignore it in their content \\~ The Liking Principle.\n\n# 💰 Monetization (Make More Money)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Make It Easy For Partners**\n\nSponsors and partners don’t really care about the backstory.\n\nThey care whether your audience is aligned with theirs and whether you can drive results.\n\nOn the Pinch Of Yum “Sponsored Content” contact page you have:\n\n\\- A very **brief** backstory\n\n\\- Different types of sponsored content they can produce\n\n\\- Brands they’ve worked with before\n\n\\- Previous case studies (including the number of clicks/views they’ve driven to brands before)\n\n\\- A contact form to find out more\n\n\\- Precise numbers, evidence of past results, and a call to action.\n\n💡 *Content Psychology Tip*: We see things as more credible when they’re expressed in precise figures. When you want your audience/partners to trust you, be precise and not wishy-washy in your content \\~ Quantification Bias\n\n**6. Teach The Craft Behind The Craft**\n\nPinch Of Yum has a thriving membership program.\n\nBut it isn’t a cooking program.\n\n“Food Blogger Pro” teaches people how to become food creators themselves.\n\nThey link people to this program through their regular food blog.\n\nThey know that a proportion of their food-loving audience will want to do what they do.\n\nThose people may have come ", "subreddit" : "r/technology_and_software", "upvotes" : 7, "comments" : 2, "platform" : "reddit", "url" : "", "confidence_score" : 0.85}', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

Some quiet dread humming beneath their daily scroll. It’s like we’re collectively holding our breath, and Eric Weinstein just said it out loud.

In his now-iconic podcast appearances and essays, Weinstein doesn’t just talk about science or math. He sounds the alarm. He says we’re watching the collapse of meaning, institutions, trust, maybe even the very idea of progress itself. And the crazy part is, whether you''re chronically online or totally offline, you probably feel it too.

But here’s where it gets messy. TikTok wellness bros and pseudo-spiritual Instagram influencers hijack that anxiety and sell you "just meditate and journal and everything will be fine" advice. I’ve studied social systems, collective cognition, and narrative collapse for years. What they’re pushing isn''t just wrong, it''s dangerous. They want your attention, not your clarity. Meanwhile, Weinstein is pointing to something way bigger: the decay of trust in expertise, the breakdown of meaning-making institutions, and the rise of a post-truth internet feeding us dopamine over truth.

I’m breaking this down for anyone who’s been doomscrolling and whispering, “Is it just me, or is all of this getting really weird?”

Let’s dive into the real tools to make sense of this moment.

---

Step 1: Learn to spot the narrative collapse

Weinstein coined the term “The Distributed Idea Suppression Complex” ,  basically, a system where good ideas get buried not by censorship, but by noise, confusion, and misaligned incentives.

Nobody believes institutions anymore. Media trust is at a record low, according to Gallup’s 2023 report, with only 32% of Americans expressing trust in traditional news. In academia, people whisper that peer review is broken. Government? Tech? Finance? All soaked in skepticism.

So how do you survive this?

- Practice “epistemic self-defense”: Ask, “Who benefits if I believe this?”
- Get skeptical about virality. If something’s trending, ask why it’s surfacing now and who’s helping it rise.
- Use Michael Nielsen’s idea of “cognitive decoupling” ,  the ability to separate emotions from analysis. This doesn’t mean you stop feeling, just that you don’t let rage or despair drive your conclusions.

, 

Step 2: Train your discernment muscles (don’t let the algorithm think for you)

You can''t rely on old filters anymore. The media gatekeepers are gone, and the algorithm doesn’t care what’s true ,  it wants what’s sticky.

Here’s what helps:

- Read The Information: Yes, it’s pricey. But it’s one of the last uncompromising tech publications with zero fluff and deep sourcing.
- Follow Richard Hanania or Antonio García Martínez ,  both are deeply critical thinkers who challenge mainstream narratives without descending into chaos.
- Listen to The Portal (Eric’s own podcast). Especially episodes with Bret Weinstein, Bari Weiss, and Peter Thiel. They’re not easy listens ,  they force you to think.
- Use BeFreed, an AI-powered self-growth app built by former Google engineers and Columbia University researchers. It turns expert research, book summaries, and talks into personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans tailored to your goals. You can control the depth ,  choose between 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives ,  and even customize the voice. It’s science-based, constantly evolving with your feedback, and helped me replace doomscrolling with actual clarity. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.

, 

Step 3: Upgrade your mental operating system

If you’re feeling like you can’t hold all the contradictions of this world anymore ,  that’s because your brain’s running outdated software.
