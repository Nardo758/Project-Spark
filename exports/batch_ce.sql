And honestly?

It’s taken a ridiculous amount of stress off my plate.

Instead of chasing threads all day, I get actual opportunities delivered to me *exactly when they matter*.

Now I’m opening it up to early users, because I have a feeling I’m not the only one who’s been missing out on conversations that could’ve changed everything.

So I’d love to hear from you:

1. Do you feel like you miss customer conversations just because you don’t see them in time?
2. What would you want a tool like this to track for you first ?
3. How much time do you think this could save you each week ?

Happy to answer questions about how it works.

Curious what others do:

- Where do you save prompts that work well?
- How do you organize the outputs (the stuff AI creates)?
- Do you have any system for improving prompts over time, or is it just trial and error?
- If you work with a team, how do you share what’s working?

I feel like I’m reinventing the wheel every time I start a new chat. There has to be a better way.
