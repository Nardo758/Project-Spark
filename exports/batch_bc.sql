i have thin, straight hair with highlights.

i discovered this small company called "cornish seaweed" online and the reviews seemed great. i bought their super nutrient shampoo & conditioner + their hair serum. the shampoo didn''t lather at all and turned my hair into a birdnest and the conditioner wasn''t good enough to help it untangled. i had to was my hair every other day (before I could''ve gone three days straight). the serum was amazing though - it made my hair incredibly soft but then again after a day, my hair was extremely dry. apparently, their haircare acts like a detox for your hair, and after a month, it becomes soft and it gets its volume back. i used it for a month and a half, lost half of my hair, waiting for the detox period to end but nothing happened. so i just gave up on it. 

then i bought ordinary''s cleanser and conditioner. i had the same problem with the shampoo (doesn''t lather), luckily this time their conditioner was amazing and it helped me untangle my hair. my hair stopped falling, but this time the problem was that it left my hair dry after every wash. 

finally, my sister suggested olaplex and i got their no 4 & 5 a month ago. the shampoo lathers so good, i felt conditioner wasn''t as good as ordinary in the first use. today was my third time using it and finally made some progress with the conditioner as well and left shower with soft hair. however, i lost hair normal than usual again during showering.

i honestly don''t know what to do. i spent so much money on these expensive haircare products and i''m still not getting to where I want with my hair: back to my usual volume, soft and moisturised. 

should i just say f\*ck it and go back to a store brand?
