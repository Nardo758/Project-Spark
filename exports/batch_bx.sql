Aaanyway, **the biggest change** I noticed was that missions became shorter and there were more missions. I liked that change! I''d rather go in for an intense 15-20-minutes battle and read some lore for another 15-20 minutes than play for an hour uninterrupted. So, in relation of the flow, and in relation to the number of missions, I''d say that I like this DLC better than the other DLC and even the main game. Oh, in relation to bossess too, **best clans experience**.

Weapons and mechs wise - again, we were in for a treat. I liked Arrow IV and artillery strikes especially, when they were available, but "good old laser vomit" is still efficient. New mechs are good, especially Naga.

I need to mention though that since sometimes my FPS were so low game almost turning into a slideshow, sometime around the middle of the campaign I switched from Normal difficulty to Story, and have not had to repeat a single mission. Story difficulty is perfect, I think, for those who are in for the story and lack reaction or processing power, be it PC or person-specific.

**Glitches and issues:**

Well, apart from the obvious, I noticed that in the final mission of WoT Elementals chief Olin got replaced with a woman from previous DLC or vanilla, iirc, what was her name, Zara, Zagra, Zathra? She was confirming/providing feedback on my commands for the Elementals. I found it amusing but missed my pal Olin a little bit.

It seems to me that Clans became more optimized. I expected WoT to run slower than the Jags or GB, considering that quite often we have more allied mechs than just our star in the field, but I have not noticed any change to the worse.

This DLC is a fully linear experience, can''t choose mission order or make any decisions in-game.

The star you control is lead by a woman, again! So, we have 2 DLCs when stars were led by women and only one when a man was in charge. Tell you what, I have no problem with it, lol.

In general, WoT feels like a pretty polished experience, very balanced, I liked that authors of the DLC made another good "war story".

I can imagine how difficult it can be to make new games/DLCs and not drown in repetition, and I like how Pirahnas are making little new things trickle with every new story/DLC, both in Mercs and Clans, little by little, but not too much. Every time there is something new to use and enjoy slightly different experience.

I wonder what will be next? Long Tom artillery? Urbie nukes? Mini-game of promoting/demoting/firing/hiring star members? Moar customization options, B. Betty voice customization? Oh yes, and please please keep those cinematic sequences or even make more of them! Make a movie! Make mechwarrior series!

On that note, I want to thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed it.

I liked it, obviously.\n\n**Ghost Bears DLC:** introduction of Elementals. I liked my little helpers throughout campaigns, and was very sorry when I accidentally shot one or two attacking enemy mech. Fortunately, I have soon learned to use them as a distraction to soften up long range support and/or heavy hitters while my main lance is focusing fire on enemies up close. In other words, focus fire lance (R, F1-F1), send toadies to attack something else (R, F6-F1), in that order.\n\nI *felt* that the DLC was a bit too short, but I liked introduction of new mechs, and many of them! Also, this DLC seemed to be more for the story rather than mech battles. I got impressed by the story more than the missions. I wish there was an alternative ending though.\n\nIt was not easy to beat the certain boss, mostly because the battle was timed. I hate timed battles. I hate timed everything since I turned 40, ackshully.\n\n**Wolves of Tukayyid** have been released on my birthday, December 4th, when I turned 45, so I could not miss making myself the gift of my fave franchise DLC. Took me some time to start it after... celebration though. It is not easy to properly recover from celebration when you''re over 40.\n\nAaanyway, **the biggest change** I noticed was that missions became shorter and there were more missions.

That''s on me, but I''m still salty about it. Mom said it''s my turn on the complaining merry-go-round.', 'So housing update releases. I wake up at 5am for it and spend an atrocious amount of time building. I love building. Truly. People enjoy my cave, start telling me to enter the competition, damn, didn''t expect that - okay!! Let''s lock in and do this!!

I load up a new scheme and start working on a massive Cave 2.0 build. I work on it for multiple hours every day. I try my best to use low cost materials where I can, but no matter how much I try, I still can see that there''s no way I''ll make it unless I shell out at least some diamonds on Astralites to keep growing fish and flowers. Okay fine. 50 diamonds here, 50 there...

At this point, the playing field still seems sort of level. Housing insight is limited for everyone, yeah you can accelerate crafting, but everyone needs to wait for the flowers and fish to grow, right? I diligently keep running Nikki all day every day, farming those flowers non-stop...

And then around 5-6 days later I start seeing insane builds, and realise you can just buy materials with Astralites. This is where my motivation plumeted.

I truly, genuinely wish that buying Astralites for diamonds was *blocked until the competition was over*. To give everyone an ACTUAL level playing field, where we are ALL limited the same way and have to really ramp up the creativity department to work around these limits. But no, instead it''s a wallet slinging competition...

And this isn''t to say there''s no creativity in slinging your wallet. That RV build that was popular here last week was INSANE and genuinely I could never be that galaxy brained. There''s obviously nuance.

But a lot of the cool housing I see is just people using a lot of expensive items to make it look impressive, and that completely ruins the spirit of the competition for me.
