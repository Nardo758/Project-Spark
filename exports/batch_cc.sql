Does anyone else hate being expected to be the counterexample to the female experience?

Im 21, in my final year of college. I’m 5’10.5, so I’m not even really that tall. But, I’m taller than every girl I know and quite a lot of men. I’m fine with that, and honestly I like being tall! If it weren’t for the people being annoying and finding pants, I really wouldn’t have a single complaint. It gives me a lot of free aura. but I’m tired of three things:

1. Expected to be dominant “mommy” “tree to climb”
2. Expected to happily date shorter
3. Expected to “rock my height” wherever I go.

For context, I’m also black and naturally retain muscle pretty easily, so I’m pretty strong too. But people treat me like I’m this super aggressive “put men in their place” figure. I wouldn’t say that’s the case - I’m not traditional by any means and I’m pretty career oriented, but I think that’s the norm for women nowadays. And somehow, not being a tradwife + being tall means im a dominitrix. And my friends always want me to consider people who are shorter than me or men they perceive as submissive. It’s always something along these lines:

“You can show the world that there’s nothing wrong with it!” 

“There’s nothing wrong with that right? 5’8 is fine though, cmon”

🔁 translating 🔁

“You are reminding us about the problematic standards we live by. seeing as you’re an edge case application, you need to bear the burden of breaking that standard to make as us feel like better people”

Why is that MY problem? These girls could also date men shorter than them and show the world, but they don’t want to. So they just export that burden to their nearest tall friend. I don’t want to be in a relationship that continues to permeate the idea that I’m this aggressive figure. It’s so frustrating that I told them to stop trying to set me up with people if they aren’t actually going to listen to me.

And I’m also super inexperienced - I’ve never had sex with, dated, kissed, or even held hands with a guy before. So, I think another part of why this upsets me so much is because I feel like I’m getting an undertone of “you’re not good enough for what you want - and that’s been made clear by you’re lack of history, so, you have to accept fringe / niche relationship types bc those ppl (guys who can’t pull a woman their height or guys with a tall girl fetish) are the only ones who would consider you”
