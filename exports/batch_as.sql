Neuromorphic computing might seem like a new field, but its origins date back to the 1980s. It was the decade when Misha Mahowald and Carver Mead developed the first silicon retina and cochlea and the first silicon neurons and synapses that pioneered the neuromorphic computing paradigm.

This article explores what neuromorphic engineering is, why it was created, how it operates today, its deep connections with modern AI, and the scientists and institutions pushing this technology forward.



# What Is Neuromorphic Engineering?

# The Core Concept

Neuromorphic computing is a method of computer engineering in which elements of a computer are modeled after systems in the human brain and nervous system. The term refers to the design of both hardware and software computing elements.

Neuromorphic engineering is a research discipline that tries to bridge the gaps between neuroscience and engineering, cognition and algorithms, and natural and artificial intelligence.

In simpler terms: Neuromorphic engineering builds computers that work like brains — not just software that mimics neural networks, but actual physical hardware that processes information the same way biological neurons do.

# Key Principles

Coined by Carver Mead in the late 1980s, the term ''neuromorphic'' originally referred to systems and devices replicating certain aspects of biological neural systems

The field is defined by several brain-inspired properties:

* In-memory computing — computation and storage happen in the same physical location
* Hardware learning — circuits adapt through physical changes, not just software updates
* Spike-based processing — information encoded in discrete events (spikes) rather than continuous values
* Fine-grained parallelism — millions of operations happening simultaneously
* Reduced precision computing — using approximate, low-power calculations instead of high-precision digital math

# Three Interconnected Domains

Neuromorphic research can be divided into three areas. 

Firstly, "neuromorphic engineering" employs either CMOS technology or cutting-edge post-CMOS technologies to reproduce the brain''s computational units and 
mechanisms. 

Secondly, "neuromorphic computing" explores new data processing methods, frequently drawing inspiration from biological systems. 

Lastly, the development of "neuromorphic devices" marks the third field, taking advantage of advancements in electronic and photonic technologies.
