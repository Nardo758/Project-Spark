I had a plumber (UK, Midlands) in to fit a new boiler and re-do a bathroom. There seem to be quite a few finish issues, and so I am looking for opinions and he has asked me to leave a review. I''m not sure I''m very impressed, but he seemed very proud, and seemed upset when i criticized his joinery, so I''m not sure if I''m being unfair. Started great, but really started to question parts of it and frankly, was just done with them by the end. Parts are from Clifton Bathrooms, whom I have learnt a lot about their business practices recently and don''t think I would use them again. Excellent communication when after money, very poor otherwise. The whole thing has been a massive learning experience (maybe for them too).

Boiler - £3.5k cost with new valves on 9 radiators. Condensate now going into bath waste pipe rather than out of wall. New gas pipe running to it as the previous one was apparently too thin. Boiler is Worcester Greenstar 4000 30 kW Combi.

Bathroom completely gutted and redone £6.1k + £2.8k for the actual suite.

New vertical radiator in living room £684

Which tbh all seems quite expensive, but i could only get this guy and we were in a hurry to get the boiler done. We did not rush him at all though or impose any timescale - whole thing took about a month.

As I know little to nothing about boilers and plumbing, I wonder if there is anything obvious about the pipework etc. that looks odd here? 

Particularly, the side panel on the bath seems loose (been back to remedy already with more sealant - pic 4) and the hose beneath the bath is not attached to the wall either (pic 2+3) - they said these are ok, but I am starting to wonder.

The door is the original door, but they did not want to finish that for some reason. The ''architrave'' looks like molding/beading to me. Managed to cut the bottom of the door at an angle, broke the hook off and chucked part of the bolt away with the old architrave. The bolt hole is just drilled into the beading, and the lock doesn''t actually work at all now - which tbh I found quite funny as he seemed very proud of his ''solution'' (pics 6 + 7). 

Particularly in pic 6 - does anyone know how the hole at the bottom should be fixed? It goes behind the plasterboard.

Also I had to paint the ceiling part way through for some reason - just said they don''t do that. Regularly only one was working, so had to help them shift the old cast iron bath, chase cables through the loft. Gave them about 10 rolls of kitchen roll and infinite tea and coffee, so I don''t feel I''ve been a bad customer.

There is a small hole in one of the panels that they just put some grey sealant in without telling me which is pretty annoying. The silicone around the top of the room barely touches across to the panels from the ceiling and there are some gaps there too. Some of the siliconing is really neat, some is really bad.

I have started dating someone with PTSD one month ago. He did not really mention he had PTSD in the beginning, nor was he really transparent about it - like he did not lie, but also not tell me what really was going on. We started going out in the beginning of November and it started off really, really well, he told me he wants to be in something serious and he made the effort for it.  
So after week two or so, he told me had PTSD, he was in the army 9 years (when he was 21) ago in a pretty demanding combat unit. After he got out of the army he was kind of functional and had jobs, but his solution was to smoke a lot of weed, that was it. Two years ago (he was 28) he got such a bad flashback that basically left him dysfunctional. He lives off state benefit, has full disability so he does not work at all, has a service dog, goes to therapy once a week and smokes a lot of medical weed. He does not take anti depressants.  
So far, it was a little overwhelming, still i thought I would give this a chance because I really did like him. 

After some time, I have realized/found out some of his behaviors, that are turning out to be really confusing. What I could see from the very beginning were some OCD behaviors, like he always needed to wash his hand after he gave a treat to the dog or he obsessively checked if the doors were locked.   
When I slept at his place, it turned out he can not sleep without any lights, like the bedroom was dark but the rest of the flat needed to be lit. Also, he smokes this heavy weed during the whole day.   
One of his triggers are children. One time, we were woken up by children literally crying in front of his flat, he freaked out and went outside to tell the father to take the children away. (I understand the trigger, yet I felt it is a little embarrassing...)  
Then later that day we went outside, and like a lot of our conversations he got triggered. We basically talked about his dog, and for a long time I did not know that the dog was a service dog, and that he gets supported by the state through dog training and stuff and that his social worker does not help him at all and that he is mad. Then he proceeded: "I know you will not like what I have to say now, but in this year we had two cases in the state where a PTSD guy killed their social workers and I totally understand that and I would consider that too." He was so triggered by this, that I saw his anger coming up, and then he took it out on the dog (bc the dog pulled) and he grabbed him at the leash and pulled him back so hard the dog started crying. I started to be scared of him and we ended up parting ways that day, because he was so triggered and I got scared. Anyways, he never apologized for this behavior at all - to my surprise. After that, he just reached out normally like it never happened.

  
Additionally, next to those behavioral issues, he got those very extreme trust issues going on. Like he painted it that he always was the victim in his last relationships. Like his ex from two years ago just left him in his country (she was also a foreigner) and never came back. Since then he only does F+ but even those hurt him, like recently three months before we started dating he got so hurt by his F+ bc she had another guy in the end. (Which for me is normal, if you have F+ you can not claim a person but ok)  
Anyways, from the very beginning he put this on me - that he can not trust me, not even in two months (*my visa would have expired in two months but since I wanted to move there permanently it did not matter in the end of the day*), because who knows, I could also leave the country and never come back. He basically used this argument against me, in every situation possible and also told me that he does not know when he can commit to this seriously because if this does not have at least 3-6 months of a talking stage he does not know if he can do this.   
Meanwhile he told me, he knows he is a bad option and that there would be way better guys for me, I could start dating other guys next to him and if it does not work out with the others we can try. Which seemed to me more like a test -- I did not go out with other guys and I am not planning too, yet it felt to me very much - if I do not do it he thinks I am clingy, if I do it he has the proof that I am not trustworthy. 

Another issue was the S\*x. I told him I only go intimate with guys I see something potentially serious with. He respected that. After some time and sleep overs we got intimate orally, but every time before penetration he blocked it, telling me this does not feel right and that he does not wanna hurt me or play me. In the beginning I bought it - but after some while not anymore!! Because to me, he always aroused me, and he always was with a boner, yet he always found reasons to block the intimacy.

I called "*Necropolis*", the third entry in Abnett''s longest running series my favorite Black Library novel and I could, and have, gush about it endlessly. All that being said, can it''s successor "*Honour Guard*" match the same level of quality? A high bar to be sure, let''s find out.

"*Honour Guard*" opens with the final stages of an Imperium liberation of a Chaos occupied shrineworld; Hagia. A planet notable for being the birthplace of Saint Sabbat, the woman whom the whole Sabbat worlds cluster is named for, as well as being the whole reason that the late Warmaster Slaydo embarked on the Sabbat Worlds Crusade in the first place, a pious man and a devotee of the Saint, he wished to make the traditional pilgrimage to the world she was born. Slaydo of course died before he could do so, Ibram Gaunt however, gets the chance.

Hagia is an ancient world so full of unspeakably old crypts, temples, and shrines that even the sewers of the last Chaos occupied city, the Doctrinopolis, are replete with them, and utilized to great effect by the ever resourceful Ghosts to combat their enemy; the Infardi. Meaning simply “pilgrim” in the local tongue, the Infardi take the name mockingly, themselves being barbarous, unwashed parodies of Sabbat’s true believers. They and their mastermind; the illusive Pater Sin, have held the world in their repulsive grip until now, the Imperium has nearly crushed them, their last stronghold here is here in the Doctrinopolis. Gaunt and his Ghost’s flush them out, and right when victory seems certain, a trap is sprung. The Infardi leave an unwelcome surprise, the temple that dominates the city skylines was rigged to explode, and the blast takes the lives of over a hundred Guardsmen, and worse, functions as a psychic beacon, a signal in the warp, a go-ahead to the slavering monstrosities loyal to the Ruinous Powers. A fleet of Chaos warships comes for Hagia now, they will be there in days, and ruin and death will follow.

What follows is Gaunt following into a deep depression, picking up a drinking habit and a tendency to spend hours on end brooding in his office, endlessly replaying the events that led to the explosion that functions as a harbinger of Hagia''s doom, I''m not a huge fan of this admittedly. Gaunt has always faced down every setback, tragedy, and defeat with an almost superhuman level of stoicism, sometimes seeming more statue than man. I don''t mind that Abnett chose to have the Colonel-Commisar''s armor crack, its an interesting idea, but the fact that it happens here, over the death of around 100 guardsmen, those men not even among the ranks of the Tanith, and not say, during the battle for Vervunhive in the last book, when defeat seemed certain a half dozen times, seems a bit contrived. After all, Gaunt falls into his slump immediately after the operation''s conclusion, before its even revealed to him that Chaos warships are on their way to scour Hagia of life, so his despair makes even less sense, but I''ll put aside this minor gripe for now, Gaunt''s not the only Ghost who faces personal demons in this novel.
