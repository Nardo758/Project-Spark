Why must you always hurt me? Why am I NEVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? I try and I try and I try and you don''t care. It comes down to you not loving me enough. Plain and simple.\n\nI would''ve done anything to be with you. I moved across the country twice to be with you. I surprised you for your birthday less than a month ago for a weekend getaway. I thought about you every day. I loved being with you, just watching a movie or being lazy. I loved cooking for you. I loved living with you. \n\nI try and I try and I try and I am never good enough for you. You broke up with me a year and a half ago for having no \"work eithic\" and no direction. We got back together. Now I have a great job and am starting grad school and yet you still dump me again. Now I have direction and it''s still not good enough. You call me selfish, you call me self-possessed. Does that make you feel better blaming it all on me? I accepted you despite your faults, why couldn''t you do the same? I didn''t know these issues were still bothering you...and you call me uncommunicative. \n\nYou''ll never find anyone who loved you as much as I did. I know someday I''ll find someone who loves me more than you ever did though.\n\nI''ve lost 6 pounds already, in the span of 5 days. I need pills to sleep at night. I''m an empty shell. I went to therapy this morning and cried my eyes out. I can''t believe we still have to live together through this. You knew I didn''t know if my job would become permanent until next month. You knew I was starting grad school in a few weeks. You knew I had to take my car into the shop and had no ride to work except for you. You knew all this and you still dumped me. I''m so hurt. I''m so angry. Mainly I''m so dissappointed in you - that you could treat me like this. I could NEVER do this to you - I guess that''s why we are so different.\n\nGod, help me breathe again.

Rotated between ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Blackbox for different projects. Here''s my honest breakdown:

# ChatGPT (GPT-4)

**Pros:**

* Incredible for explaining concepts and breaking down complex problems
* Great at suggesting multiple approaches to solve something
* The conversation format makes it easy to iterate and refine

**Cons:**

* Code can be unnecessarily verbose and over-commented
* Sometimes makes assumptions about your tech stack
* Slower response times during peak hours
* Can hallucinate library functions that don''t exist

**Best for:** Learning new concepts, architectural discussions, debugging logic errors

# Claude (Sonnet/Opus)

**Pros:**

* Writes genuinely clean, production-quality code
* Excellent at refactoring and code review
* Better at understanding context from longer conversations
* More careful about edge cases and error handling

**Cons:**
