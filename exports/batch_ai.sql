In late December 2024, I applied for the job role "Barista Maestro" (Shift Leader/Duty Manager) at an Equity Costa Coffee (owned and operated by Costa themselves). In early January, I had an interview and was told I was actually the only person who applied for the job (makes sense why now) anways I got the job. To add some context, I had no Barista experience at all, but I did have managerial experience. I was told that I was actually going to start working at the store I had my interview in for ''training'' instead of the store I actually applied for. I was fine with this since the store I had my interview in was actually a lot closer than the store I applied for. I was also told that as well as this being because of training, it was also because this store (the one I had my interview in) was actually one of the busiest store in the area, so they basically wanted to throw me in the deep end, train me all up and then send me to the more quieter store (the one I originally applied for). Again, I was fine with this, however as I started working there, I wasn''t actually given any training at all - now i''m not blaming the store specifically, as again it was a really busy store in a huge shopping centre so they basically never put me on the coffee machine - I was stuck on pots most of my time there. I kept asking the store manager when I was going to the original store but she said she had no idea. At the time, the store I originally applied for was essentually going down hill - their store manager had quit without notice, their staff kept calling in sick and the store ended up either being clsoed most days, or begging for cover from local stores. At the same time, the area managers were changing, as the current area manager was only seconded until the original area manager came back from maturnity (which was happening at the time). Everyone that I was working with kept warning me about the store that I was going to saying that they wish me luck and have actually been sent to work there and that it was horrible - this obviously was scaring me as I was really enjoying my time at this store that I was training at and really liked everyone there (even though I was stuck on pots 90% of my time there). I came in one day and the store manager said to me that she has been given a date that I will be going to the original store I applied for (at this ppint I had been at the training store for 6 weeks), she also said not to listen to everyone and that the store that I am going too will be fine, and that the Area manager (the original one now) wanted to speak to me as she was scared I was going to back out (considering I was the only one who applied for the job, and none of the baristas at the store wanted to step up to manager). Now that there was an actual date, on my last two shifts they tried to show me manager stuff such as the Log book, how to cash up etc... however, I learn by doing and all that was happening was them rushing "showing" me stuff - as ofcourse they wanted to go home at the end of the night too... I asked how do i lock the store and they said that they can''t show me because their lock system was nwer as they had a recent referb and that I would be shown on my shift in the orignial store I applied for when I get there. However, when I checked my work scheduling app, I was scheduled for shifts where I was being the only manager on shift and locking up on my own - this had never happened at the training store and again I had been given bareley any training so was not confident at all. I raised this with the store manager of my training store and she said she will speak to the store manager who was covering the original store I applied for. 

  
So 6 weeks after i''ve been hired, I am now at my first day of the original store I applied for (which is in a small town), on my first day they changed it so I was closing with another Shift Leader so I could learn how they close and stuff at that store. We done it, I more or less understood it - it was fine. A week into this store now, I was on with two baristas and me as the manager. The two baristas were busy on the floor and on the machine (as I was slower and less confident), I was cleaning the cake disply ready for close down when a teenage girl joins the queue, I take her order she wanted a tea with oat milk. I got a takeaway up, prepared the tea - asked her when I should stop with the oat milk and put the lid on the side for her to put on (as I had gloves on and was on my way to serve the next person in the queue. 5 minutes later, the teenage girl goes up to one of the baristas (which I thought was odd) and I over hear the barista say "okay, well \[my name\] is the manager at the moment, so you will have to speak to him."

So here is my current situation.  I probably have 2 kids in one class where the teachers have dismissed them as special. One can''t sit still in his character, randomly talks/yells in his first language and occasionally yells and slaps his own face repeatedly. He sits with the other students, allowed to participate in class.

Now there''s another kid in the class. He always sits at the back. All the students swap desks every week but he always stays in the same spot. He often does whatever he wants, stands up, walks around the back. And often he likes to play with the girls'' hair if they sit in front of him.

Now when I do group games or activities - I get the students dismissed him saying he''s crazy. However, I will try to involve him because I have seen he does know some English if you press him 1-on-1 and he can do it in games although very slow.

Anyway, I''ve been told to leave him on his own, he''s special. But from what I''ve seen, he isn''t disruptive. 

A foreign teacher (who frankly is a terrible teacher I digress) told me off for not disciplining him. I said the teachers told me he''s special. He thinks he''s just naughty and that the kid tried to manipulate him.

But honestly I don''t know what the right way is when it comes to kids like him and others. Because in my experience in Asia, there isn''t much handling of kids that are "special" or mentally challenged (is that the right wrong). Schools I''ve been, they either don''t want to deal with them. Or ignore them or keep them secluded in the classroom.

My co teachers seems to think ignoring him is best. She doesn''t like him and how he treats the girls, being inappropriate towards girls, and worried that the girls will think its okay and I understand. Even his homeroom teacher always holds his hand whenever it''s time to leave the school to hand off to his parents.

I just don''t think isolating him from the lesson by ignoring him is the answer. I think the reason I keep pushing is because if I ask him or point to something he does know it or try. Whereas other kids the school may write off as "special" don''t.


So how do you deal with problem students in an environment that doesn''t talk about or have the awareness or support therefore many write them off? And you feel limited on how to help because of the language barrier.
