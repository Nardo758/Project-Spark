**The Foundation: CLI + TUI**

**Problem**: Editing .resx XML manually is error-prone. Visual Studio''s editor is basic. Linux has nothing.

**Solution**: Terminal-first tool with interactive UI:

- **Keyboard-driven TUI** - Side-by-side language editing, regex search, undo/redo
- **Smart validation** - Catches missing keys, duplicates, format string mismatches (`{0}`, `{name}`)
- **Code scanning** - Detects unused keys in .resx, missing keys in code
- **Auto-translate** - 10 providers including **free Ollama** (local AI, no API key)
- **Backup system** - Auto-backup with diff viewer before destructive operations
- **Automation** - JSON output, scripting support, CI/CD workflows

**The Cherry: VS Code Extension**

Brings LRM''s power into your editor:

- **Live diagnostics** - Red squiggles for missing localization keys as you type
- **Autocomplete** - IntelliSense for `Resources.`, `GetString("`, `_localizer["` patterns
- **CodeLens** - See reference counts, translation coverage inline in code
- **Quick fixes** - Add missing keys, translate on the spot

**Bonus: Web UI**

Browser-based dashboard for non-terminal users (powered by the same CLI backend).

**Links**:

- VS Code Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nickprotop.localization-manager

**Perfect for**:

- Multi-language SaaS apps
- Open-source projects with international users
- Teams without dedicated translation resources
- Anyone tired of manual .resx editing
