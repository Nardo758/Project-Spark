# Why this league feels different

This Madden cycle is generous with XP/dev — and instead of nerfing it, we lean into it:

* Normal dev picks can become stars quickly
* UDFAs can turn into legit franchise players
* Position changes and experimentation are encouraged
* Cap management and CPU trades still require real thought



You’ll play a lot of CPU — but so does everyone else.

When breakouts and development are on the line league-wide, it stops feeling like filler and starts feeling competitive in a different way.



# Open Divisions

* **AFC North**



If you’ve ever thought *“I wish there was a league that actually let me build something weird and see it play out”* — this is probably it.

I’ve been experimenting with concepts for an AI-generated short film or music video, and I’ve run into a recurring challenge: maintaining stylistic and compositional consistency across an entire video.

We’ve come a long way in generating individual frames or short clips that are beautiful, expressive, or surreal but the moment we try to stitch scenes together, continuity starts to fall apart. Characters morph slightly, color palettes shift unintentionally, and visual motifs lose coherence.

What I’m hoping to explore is whether there''s a current method or at least a developing technique to preserve consistency and narrative linearity in AI-generated video, especially when using tools like Runway, Pika, Sora (eventually), or ControlNet for animation guidance.

To put it simply:

> Is there a way to treat AI-generated video more like a modern evolution of traditional 2D animation where we can draw in 2D but stitch in 3D, maintaining continuity from shot to shot?



Think of it like early animation, where consistency across cels was key to audience immersion. Now, with generative tools, I’m wondering if there’s a new framework for treating style guides, character reference sheets, or storyboard flow to guide the AI over longer sequences.

If you''re a designer, animator, or someone working with generative pipelines:

How do you ensure scene-to-scene cohesion?
