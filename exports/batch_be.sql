I have a sizeable VT position in my taxable account. (While not very relevant here, all my other accounts are 100% VEQT).

I want to add VCN to the taxable account because I''d like to add in some home country bias to smooth out currency volatility and increase tax efficiency:

- I don''t want to sell VT (thus triggering large cap gains) just to switch over to VEQT.
- So, I would just buy VCN now onwards until the Canadian portion of the account (i.e. VCN + 2% Canada in VT) become about ~25%.
- This way, I get the Canadian dividend tax credit benefit which VEQT provides (through VCN in this case).
- Since VCN and VT both have a MER of 0.06%, I don''t increase spend on fees either.
- Once ~25% is attained, then buy VEQT (plus any VCN/VT rebalances using new money as needed to maintain the ratio)

Now, I am aware that while this fixes the home country bias challenge, it won''t do away with US Estate Tax related filings when the time comes. 

Honestly, I wish there was a way to replace VT with VEQT without a huge tax bill, but aside from Estate Taxes, the "add VCN" approach seems like the optimal way to get close to VEQT-like attributes (with an unintended bonus of a 0.06% MER).

If you’re the type who:

* enjoys **building a roster over seasons**
* likes experimenting with positions and player roles
* actually cares about progression, cap decisions, and long-term team identity
* gets bored playing the same “correct” way every league



…then you’re probably in the wrong leagues.



**miniFL** is an 8-user, adult sim league built around the *team-building loop*.

Light rules. Honor system. Freedom to build your team your way — in exchange for balanced, non-lobby gameplay (no Bunch/Tight spam).



We’re in **Season 5**, and the league has developed real continuity — teams, storylines, and reputations that carry over year to year.
