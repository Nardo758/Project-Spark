Lois waited for Clark to pick up his phone a third time, but there was still no answer. Where could he be?

“Still no answer?” said Chloe in a small window on Lois’ laptop screen.

“I can go look for him,” Kara offered from the couch, scrolling through her phone. She was there to keep an eye on Lois and the kids, in case they were targeted next, but she wanted to help.

There hadn’t been any reported sightings of Superman in action since he went to look for more clues. Lois had to get a hold of him. She had discovered the mastermind behind the robotic attacks and kidnappings of their friends and colleagues was Dabney Donovan, Co-Founder of Cadmus Labs. And the target of Lois’s first front-page story ever.

Way before Cadmus was publicly known, Donovan did his own scientific research. Filled with its own ethical violations. Perhaps that’s why he carried out those studies on his own? Cadmus had its own questionable practices, but what Donovan did was next level.

She still wasn’t quite sure how Eddie fit into it. Sure, she knew him socially, but he felt like an outlier in the grand scheme.

Lois ended the attempted call to her husband and shook her head. “It’s okay, Kara,” Lois answered. “I’ll catch Clark up when he gets back. For now, we have to find Donovan.”

Chloe typed away on her end. “I’ll look up any possible connections to that company he ran back in the day. What was it called again?”

“Eidolon,” Lois answered softly as she drifted toward the window.

“Of course,” Chloe chuckled. “They always go for the Greek mythology.”

It seemed like so long ago, but it was still fresh in Lois’s mind. Working for the Daily Planet as a teenager was an exciting time. She made new friends, uncovered nefarious activities, and cemented her legacy at the esteemed newspaper, quickly becoming a rising star.

“You still with me?” Chloe asked, interrupting her reminiscing.

Lois turned back to her laptop. “Yeah,” she said. “Just thinking back.”

**Daily Planet**

*Years Ago*

---

After moving around from army base to army base, Lois and her family were finally settling down in Metropolis. It was a relief to stay in one place finally, but so far she had found it hard to make friends at school. And some sleuthing around the faculty got her into trouble with the principal. Her dad, The General, wasn’t happy about that.

But her “extracurricular” activities eventually reached Perry White, the Daily Planet''s Editor-in-Chief. He was looking for students to join an experimental program in which teens would investigate and report stories with their own special column in the paper. Principal Butler had his flaws, but Lois couldn’t dislike him *too* much after she was the first name he recommended to Perry.

Convincing the General to let her join after her troubles at school was a challenge, but she managed to convince him it was for the best. Luckily, her mom had her back, too. Well, and her sister Lucy, but it didn’t really matter what she thought.

The cab slowed as it approached the historic Daily Planet building, and Lois couldn’t help but hold her breath. People shuffled in and out of the glass doors, each with their own determined mission. Her eyes were drawn upward, first to the old school, Art Deco design, which made the building act like a living photograph of the past.

And then there was the globe.

The giant, golden sphere had the letters “Daily Planet” circling its center, as if in orbit. It was wondrous and magical. Its almost futuristic feel, in sharp contrast to the antiquity of the rest of the building, seemed like a promise that it would always be there.

After paying for her ride and exiting the vehicle, she slowly approached the revolving door, admiring the distinguished wear of the golden metal.
