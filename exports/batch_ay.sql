# **Alexander Mercouris: EU''s Illegal Asset Seizure and Russia''s Legal Counterattack**  
*A Comprehensive Summary of the December 13, 2025 Broadcast*

---

## **00:00-09:00: The Shadowy EU Institution and the "Before and After" Moment**

Mercouris frames the current situation as a historic inflection point marking a clear "before and after" divide. The catalyst is a controversial decision by the EU''s Council of Representatives—an institution he refers to as **"Korea"** (from its French acronym). He emphasizes this body''s shadowy, underreported nature, noting it receives "practically none" of the media attention given to the European Commission or Parliament, yet produces "the bulk of EU legislation" through regular votes on resolutions and directives.

He recounts a revealing 2015 scandal when Greece''s new Syriza government discovered their representative at Korea had supposedly voted for Russian sanctions they never authorized. When Greek officials protested, they faced immediate retaliation: investigations into their Russian ties and coordinated media attacks. Since then, Greece has never again objected to Korea decisions, illustrating the institution''s coercive power.

The current decision, passed by majority vote rather than unanimity, fundamentally alters the legal status of approximately €140 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets. Previously requiring renewal every six months, the freeze is now indefinite—effectively permanent. Mercouris notes he cannot identify which states voted how, as Korea''s opacity makes tracking votes difficult even for dedicated researchers.

---

## **09:00-17:00: Deconstructing the EU''s Legally Absurd Declaration**

Mercouris analyzes the official text with forensic precision, highlighting its "completely distorted, twisted language." The declaration states the measures are "temporary" while simultaneously removing any mechanism for unfreezing the assets. Under EU law, this means unfreezing now requires unanimous consent—an impossibility given current geopolitical realities.

The text claims assets must remain frozen "as long as the making available of significant financial resources to Russia...pose serious economic difficulties within the union." Mercouris exposes the circular logic: **the EU''s own sanctions and asset seizure create the economic difficulties used to justify the seizure.** This "extraordinary circular logic" would be "shot to pieces immediately" in any rational court.

He identifies three psychological drivers behind the linguistic contortions:

1. **Obsessive loathing of Russia** and determination to prevent any asset return
2. **Spite toward Donald Trump**, who wants the assets for his peace deal
3. **Desperate gambler''s mentality** after 19 failed sanctions packages

---

## **17:00-25:00: Violation of Fundamental Legal Principles**

Mercouris argues the decision breaches core legal norms on multiple levels. First, **changing the rules mid-game** violates the principle that legal changes can only apply prospectively, not retroactively. Hungary voted for the initial freeze in February 2022 precisely because it retained veto power over extensions—**a "cast iron legal basis" now stolen from them.**

He quotes Viktor Orbán''s "incredibly strong language" condemning the "utter lawlessness." Orbán''s response signals likely legal action at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), possibly joined by Slovakia and others. However, Mercouris warns this could be a "very protracted legal process" given the ECJ''s history of rubber-stamping EU authority decisions. He predicts that if the ECJ upholds this decision, its reasoning "is going to become even more tortuous and bizarre than it already is."

The decision also establishes a precedent for **arbitrary, unaccountable, despotic rule** where legal principles become infinitely malleable to political will.
