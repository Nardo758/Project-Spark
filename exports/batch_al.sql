- Big eye anger when asked to do clearly impossible things like “put up your clothes” or “can you please help clean up your mess?” 
- verbal threats and insults with bangers such as “imma fucking stab you” and the classic “No one tells me what to do bitch” when reminded that some boundaries are outside our control 
- the bird in that classic “I don’t know how to do this yet” way where all the fingers are pulled way down? 
- variations on “get fucked” and “go fuck yourself” 
- property damage basically every day… why do we even try to have nice things? 
- Demands to do everything right away 
- the blame game without even a hint of irony 
- cascading messes indicating a clear trail of activity 
- watching him treat all his little friends like besties 
- him pretending he’s not in the middle of burnout 
- as an adopted kid, being told we’re “not his parents”
- having his little sister (9) tell us she’s going to just ignore all the insults and treat them like a cry for help so she will just tell him she loves him in a note or something 
- physical abuse like hitting, slapping, being attacked with thrown objects 
- big hugs and cuddles and n the back side of the most horrendous treatment 
- threats of self injury 
- being mocked by my AuDHD kid for also being AuDHD 
- constantly surprised at the stupid and ignorant thing that fall out of his mouth, and then wondering why I’m still so surprised. 

Adjustments we’ve made / are making… 

- knives, scissors, tools, tape… literally everything is locked up. 
- parents bedroom has been replaced and upgrade with commercial level security to reduce ongoing damage 
- all new doors in “the path” get similar reinforcements by default 
- fingerprint based locks on doors to make it less inconvenient for adults
- updated locks on the shed
- fancy new unbudgeted, lockable tool cabinets arriving soon 
- a fancy new on site tool box to ensure active projects are safe during escalations 
- way more screen time than ever anticipated due to … everything…
- shifting bedrooms to put all other kids on a different floor for safety reasons 
- safety protocol for other kids and training on how to identify risky moments and get out of the way 
- instinctual behaviors for clearing out messes and items in “the path” as escalations begin 
- No more school for the semester due to recurring inpatient stays and a lack of fks for educational growth over personal stability 
- showering requires one parent on duty for oversight 
- rental cars now require insurance … every time 
- family trips can’t require overnight stops 
- trying to prioritize issues so we don’t go crazy. 

Self care… as it were…

- Weekly therapy, soon for the whole family! 
- trying to engage hobbies again
- intentionally blocking time for other kids 
- clearly communicating limits to partner when we need a break 
- venting on Reddit and to the few trusted friends that actually see and accept what’s going on 
- gallows humor 
- alcohol 
- freedom to fail 
- deep breathing 
- radical authenticity 
- crying …. And then more crying…..
