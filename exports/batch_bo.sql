Manual testing doesn''t scale. You test on 10 systems, hope it works on 8,000. That''s not testing, that''s hoping.

Automated validation tests continuously at every phase. 100 systems, 500 systems, 2,000 systems—each wave validates before the next deploys.

You''re not sacrificing safety for speed. You''re achieving both through intelligence.

The Technical Bits

For the sysadmins wondering about implementation:

- Pilot group selection: Representative sample across OS versions, application configs, regional networks
- Health checks: Application-specific (can the app launch? Does core functionality work?) plus system-level (CPU, memory, network connectivity)
- Automated rollback triggers: If >5% of wave fails health checks, entire wave rolls back automatically
- Deployment velocity: Adjusts based on success rate (failures slow it down, successes speed it up)

The Honest Bit

We''re still finding applications where automated validation doesn''t work well. Custom internal apps with weird dependencies. Legacy systems with no health check capability.

For those, manual testing is still required. But that''s maybe 5% of most estates now instead of 100%.

Anyone else dealt with Friday afternoon zero-days? How do you balance speed vs safety?

We thought we''d seen every patching scenario. Then last month happened.\n\nThe Setup\n\n4:47pm Friday. Collaboration software announces zero-day. CVSS 9.8. Active exploitation in the wild. Exploit code public within 6 hours.\n\n8,000 endpoints. Global organisation. 24/7 operations across three continents.\n\nVendor patch available by 5:30pm. Our inbox: 47 escalation emails. CIO, CISO, regional directors—everyone suddenly very interested in patch management.\n\nThe Problem\n\nTraditional playbook says: Test thoroughly before deploying. Sensible advice that would leave the organisation exposed for days.\n\nAlternative playbook says: Deploy everywhere immediately. Absolutely terrible advice that could disable 8,000 systems simultaneously if there''s a config conflict.\n\nOur team was sitting there thinking: These are both bad options. There has to be a better way.\n\nWhat Actually Happened\n\nWe''d recently implemented intelligent phased deployment with automated validation. Initially, there was some scepticism internally—it seemed like over-engineering.\n\nFriday 6:15pm: Deployed to pilot group of 100 systems. Automated health checks every 15 minutes. Application launches, connectivity tests, performance baselines—all automated.\n\n7:00pm: Pilot group green. System automatically deployed to next wave of 500.\n\n8:15pm: 2,000 critical systems protected. Still zero incidents.\n\n11:30pm: All 8,000 endpoints patched and validated.\n\nMonday morning: CEO asks if the organisation is protected. Answer: Yes, since Friday night.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nWe''d been thinking about patch automation wrong. The assumption was that automation meant \"faster deployment.\" But that''s not the real value.\n\nThe real value is automated validation at scale.\n\nManual testing doesn''t scale.

What I am looking for: 

Over all performance; speed, memory, storage -  For storage on the MacBook Pro specifically, do you think I can get by on 512GB or should I go for the 1TB? I’ve had people tell me that the 1TB is excessive and takes a life time to fill up. But I’ve also heard that it actually isn’t that much and can be filled up within 2 years, especially with photos and videos. I have also been told that the 1TB has faster processors- is that true? 

Longevity - If I’m investing into something like this, I want it to last for several years. That is also where the storage and memory comes in. Does that affect anything? Is one going to last me longer than the other? I obviously know that storage will eventually run out, but there are external things I can use for storage. 

Portability - I absolutely love the screen size of the 16 inch MacBook Pro, but I’ve heard it’s not ideal to travel with like the 14 inch is. I visit family a lot and I’ll be shooting a wedding in Maine in September. Something that I can take on the plane so I can edit would be ideal. So my question is…is the 16 inch MacBook Pro worth the hassle for the screen size alone? 

The goal is to get both the MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. The MacBook for the main things and iPad for editing specifically. They will primarily be used for photo editing, video editing and I would like to get into creating digital art. I will also eventually be using this for online classes when I go back to school and promoting my work. 

One thing that I have found with my own research is that the iPad Pro with the magic keyboard essentially becomes like a MacBook. If I were to get the iPad Pro, 13inch, 2TB of storage with the magic keyboard…do you think I could bypass getting the MacBook for now and be able to accomplish everything that I am wanting? The amount of content creation isn’t going to be too insane for the first year and I know that I can get an adapter to plug into the iPad to upload my photos. I also won’t be starting classes for a while yet.
