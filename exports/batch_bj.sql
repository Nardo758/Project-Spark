The current decision process relies on scattered reviews and forum posts rather than structured comparisons of features, pricing, and use cases.', '{"original_title" : "(Very Long) Review: Knit Picks Rainbow Interchangeable Needle Set", "original_body" : "There are always a lot of questions about what needles to buy so I thought I''d do a full review of one of the common recommendations - KnitPicks Interchangeable Needles.\n\nFull disclosure, during the recent Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale, I ordered over $100 of yarn which enabled to me to get the [Rainbow Options Interchangeable Needle Set](https://www.knitpicks.com/rainbow-options-interchangeable-needle-set/p/90306) for free so I spent no money on these directly. TLDR; at the end!\n\n**Cost**\n\nThe set retails for $76.99 and includes a variety of size needles and cable lengths.\n\nIf you bought all the pieces of the set individually, the total retail cost would be $150.02 for the needles and $19.96 for the cables for a total of $169.98.\n\n**Interchangeable Tips**\n\nThe needles are made of rainbow colored laminated birch wood with a metal end piece that connects to the cable. They are 4.75in (12cm) long from tip to tip. There are 9 sizes included in the set - US 4 (3.5mm) | US 5 (3.75mm) | US 6 (4mm) | US 7 4.5mm | US 8 (5mm) | US 9 (5.5mm) | US 10 (6mm) | US10.5 (6.5mm) | US 11 (8mm).\n\nBecause the needles are all the same color, they are difficult to tell apart at a glance. The size of each needle is engraved on the end piece, but it is **tiny** so I''d strongly recommend getting a needle gauge if you don''t have one. Its just easier than squinting at the labels.\n\nThe needles are very light and have a texture more like plastic than wood due to the lamination. This makes them very smooth and very easy to use. The yarn doesn''t catch at all and they feel great in your hand. As someone who is used to aluminum needles, I like them a lot. If you are used to non-laminated wooden needles, you might find them slipperier than you are used to.\n\nThe tips are quite pointy. If you are a person who pushes the needles down with your fingers while you''re knitting (like me) it can hurt. When my fingers get sore, I use a thimble on my index finger and that helps. My assumption is the longer I use them the more they will wear down to a rounder tip so I''m not bothered by this, but it might bother you.\n\nSo far they seem pretty durable and well made but I have only used them on a couple of quick projects.\n\n**Cables** \n\nThe set comes with 4 purple nylon cables. The website lists them as two 24 inch cables, one 32 inch cable, and one 40 inch cable, but this includes the length of the needles. The actual size is two 15 inch cables, one 22 inch cable, and one 29.5 inch cable. The cables were very stiff at first but did seem to become more relaxed as I used them.\n\nThere is a 1.5 inch cable connector provided as well which allows you to join two cables together to make a longer cable. There''s only one cable connector, which I find a little disappointing. It would be nice to be able to join more than one cable if needed or to have a spare in case you lose it since its pretty small.\n\nThey provide two cable keys that you use to tighten the needles to cables and cables to the connector. If you try to hand tighten them, they will loosen while you''re knitting so you need to use the key. They are a decent wire gauge and feel pretty sturdy. I wish there was a key ring or something to put them on because I feel like they''ll be easy to lose but they are pretty standard. The join between the needles and cable is very smooth with no catching on the yarn and I had no issues with them loosening as I knitted.\n\n**Accessories** \n\nThe set comes in a 9\" x 5\" clear snapped vinyl needle case. This is just a cheap plastic case with snaps, kind of like you''d get with a set of cheap markers. The flap broke the minute I opened it so don''t count on using that as storage.\n\nThere are 8 end caps provided. You can take your needles off the cable and replace it with an end cap to hold your work on the cable and then use your needles for something else. I imagine you could also use it to create a \"flat\" knitting needle using a cable and a needle but I''m not sure why you''d do that vs knitting with the two circulars attached.\n\nI haven''t used them yet because I prefer to leave my project on the needles and use rubber needle caps but its nice to have them. If you''re someone who likes to work on a variety of projects at once on the same size needles, they will be a big help for you.\n\n**Pros and Cons**\n\nIMO the biggest perk of buying into a \"premium\" set like this is the ability to buy additional/replacement parts and different size needles. There are options from US 4 (3.5 mm) through US 17 (12mm) available in different colors and materials. There are also shorter needles (2.75 inches) which can make it easier to knit smaller circles.\n\nYou can buy different length cables as well, from 16 inches to 60 inches (from needle tip to tip, they don''t provide the actual cable length) and they come with their own cable key and end caps which is nice. You can also buy additional cable connectors.\n\nThe set themselves is very solid. They seem well made.

I just wanted to vent to some people who get it.  My mom passed away about 20 years ago from cancer (on Christmas, no less) so this time of year is always a bit rough.  But this year seems especially tricky.

My (42F) father (77M) has been showing some signs of dementia for the last few years.  I live a few states away for work but we try to visit 3-4 times a year.  I have a 5 year old though so the last few years have been pretty toddler focused. I have an older sister who also has a 3 year old.  She lives about 4 hours away from my dad.

My dad had knee replacement surgery in 2022 and had to do some rehab after because of some complications.  He passed cognitive tests to leave rehab but I saw a side of him that was very unpleasant.  He yelled at a nurse in front of me in a really inappropriate way.  He said she had been difficult the whole time but it was a real bitterness that I had never seen before.  I had to take care of him for about a week after and he was okay but definitely got confused about some stuff.  I also saw how he was managing things like his medication (no organization, taking things whenever when they said AM or PM).  I tried to help with a few things like a pill organizer and other systems in the house before I left.  

The tricky part about my dad is that we realized about 10? years ago that he had a weed habit.  We were finding big bags of weed in his room and paraphernalia around the house.  He tries to put it away before we visit but he doesn''t do a great job.  Which is fine, he''s in adult and he lives in a legal state, but he denies it completely and it is really hard to tell whether his cognitive issues are because of that, just getting older, or dementia. I am all about him living his life but the mental part of it concerns me a bit.  He also drinks a fair amount, is on a high dosage of an antidepressant and is generally pretty lonely.

My dad lives in a house in a vacationy area that my Mom''s dad built in the 70s for very cheap.  Property values have gone up significantly since then and it''s pretty good real estate.  We knew money was getting tight and I had seen some concerning signs when visiting like overdue credit card bills, etc, but I wasn''t sure of the extent and he does not like to talk about that kind of stuff.  

A couple of months ago while on one of the weekly video calls we do for him to see my son, he told me that he was thinking of selling the house and thought he could get $1 mil for it.  He had already talked to a realtor after seeing the number on Zillow and they had told him the same number.  He talked about how he had basically run through his retirement money and was living off of social security and the rent from a tenant that lived in an attached mother in law apartment.  He had also ALREADY TOLD THE TENANT before telling me or my sister. Key point here because the house is in a trust and we are the trustees so he needs us in order to sell.

One frustrating part of this is that he announced this in October and wanted to sell right after the holidays because the realtor had told him that was the best time (?).  My family is planning on moving much closer around next summer so we could totally help him after that (he knows we are moving). We can''t move any sooner. Also, and this is a bit selfish, but I was hoping that we''d have a little time at the house after we moved closer, which is on a pond in a summer vacation spot.  Maybe a year or two so my son can have that experience before we need to sell?  I figured we would need to sell at some point but this was really rushed and unexpected.  He said he was broke but he also is terrible with money, buying big tvs and other stuff - and doing so while knowing he was doing this so close to running out of retirement money is really troubling.  I knew we''d probably have to sell the house eventually (although my sister would prefer to keep it and use it as an investment property).  The other big issue is that he is was not sure where he would live but wanted to stay in the very HCOL area he lives in now.  It''s not an easy place to find year round housing where he lives that''s not ridiculously expensive.  So there just wasn''t a lot of planning behind this huge decision.

So on a later call with my sister we tried to get to the bottom of this and asked if he really wanted to sell the house or if he wanted to stay.  If he wanted to stay, could we help him a little in the meantime?  I mean me because I have a higher paying job than my sister who is a single mom. He said he had a lot of credit card debt to pay off.  He said if he could, he would like to stay.  I ended up sending him the $10k to cover his credit cards and he told us that he then didn''t need to sell the house.  Which seems crazy - $10k fixes a problem you wanted $1mil for?

It''s not so bad if it''s a simple champion, but anything requiring combos is the death of me. Are there any tips or tricks for the scenarios below:

- Having to combo abilities, especially in different directions. For example, Ahri''s basic gameplay is ulting forward and throwing out charm quickly. I find it very awkward to have to rapidly drag in two different directions without tactile keys, it''s really easy to press on the wrong button.

- Target selection for engage / divers in large teamfights. I understand you can target select enemies, but it''s annoying when they dip in and out of vision or if you need to quickly change targets in the middle of the enemy team. Also if you tap on an ability thinking it will target your selected enemy, but they''re out of range or entered a bush and your ability smart targets to someone else instead.
