*The Best Easy Pasta Salad Recipe*

*15 Minute Lo Mein Recipe*

Notice a pattern?

Pinch Of Yum promises **ease** and **quickness** with a lot of their headlines and titles.

They know what people want.

*Takeaway*:

Attention spans are short and the average person doesn’t have time for a 3-hour masterclass.

Promising simplicity and speed in headlines and titles is often a winner and increases click-through rate.

**2. Drop Them In The Action**

You’ll notice that a lot of their Instagram Reels start with the “peak” and then transition to the beginning of the recipe.

You’ve got a few seconds to hook the audience before they scroll down, swipe away, or exit.

This is especially true when you''re competing for clicks on a newsfeed.

If you start with the empty pan, you’re unlikely to grab their attention.

But start with a quick shot of a beautiful, steaming, creamy bowl of pasta - they’re sticking around to see how to make it.

*Takeaway*:

When it comes to "how-to” content (whether it''s a blog post, long-form, or short-form video), consider using the payoff (i.e. what they’re going to make/build/learn) as the hook.

This way, the audience immediately knows whether it’s worth their time to stick around.
