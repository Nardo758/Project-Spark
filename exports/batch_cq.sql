Be available to show empty apartments or handle residents issues 24/7

Turn key all recently opened apartments with a budget of only $250 per apartment. which usually meant I did all the actual cleaning, painting, drywall, and small repairs after office hours to maintain a budget for apartments the desperately needed carpets replaced

Maintain an occupancy rate of at least 90% or forfeit my "free rent" for the month. My pay was literally my rent, water, trash, gas and electric bills paid. My husband''s job paid all the other daily life necessities. 

During this time I had one month where occupancy dipped to 85% for one week as I was doing turn key on a recently opened apartment and he shut my gas off for the month. My heating was gas and it was February in Georgia

He refused to allow me any time off for prenatal care so I has to find an OBGYN that was willing to take patients after 5 pm.

He owned multiple apartment locations and I was expected to spend weekends doing all the weekly paperwork for his other complex. In Atlanta. From 9-5, I HAD to be in that office to do any paperwork. No compensation for gas or time. 

And my personal favorite and the #1 reason I feel no remorse for this story, he literally fired me for going into labor. My water broke at 9:37 am Friday morning. I timed my contractions all day. At 5 pm I closed the office and went to the hospital with contractions at 2.15 minutes apart. I was fired because I wouldn''t be back by Monday to open the office. I was evicted Wednesday morning, the day I returned home with my new son.

I was young, I didn''t know how illegal any of that was so I just accepted it but now... I think of this day and smile every time. 

It was a cool crisp Monday morning when my boss, lets call him S, rings me up at the office. 

S - Hey OP I have a new office chair being delivered sometime this week, keep an eye out and let me know when it arrives. I''ll be gone out of town this week. Taking the missus out on one last vacation before she pops (fun fact his wife and I are due one week apart)

Me- No problem S. And then I give him the usual rundown of the apartment drama, ending with, I heard most of C building is down with some type of stomach virus so I''m gonna reschedule our pest control on that building. Don''t want to start spreading around these nasty bugs. Maybe we can get him to come back beginning of April (3 weeks away) I haven''t heard anyone complain about seeing any pests. I don''t think waiting would hurt anything.

S - Starts yelling, NO I PAID FOR THAT SERVICE AND THEY WILL GIVE US THAT SERVICE. SPRAY SOME DAMN LYSOL! YOU AND THAT BABY WILL BE JUST FINE! WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE ME YELL? JUST DO YOUR DAMN JOB!

He then slams the phone down and I continue doing my damn job. 

The next day, Tuesday the pest control company comes and I walk with him to each apartment as he sprays for pests as company policy. Then I continue doing my damn job with nothing truly eventful happening.

Wednesday morning the chair arrives. I sign for this beautiful cloth covered, heated/massage office chair and they bring it into the office and roll the old chair to the corner of the room and set up the new chair in it''s place.

Congratulations to you and Mike on the wedding. I wish you many happy years together.\n\nI am excited to share my first ever story on reddit with everyone. I have many more as I have definitely had some interesting stories through my years. But since I know how much Mike likes pooh stories I felt this one would be best as my first. I hope you enjoy it. \n\nFirst a bit of context, I, 42 F, once worked as an office manager of an apartment complex many, many years ago. This was a different time (2002-2003 to be exact) I was a different person. Early 20''s, a new mom and wife, pregnant with child #2 and learning how to juggle becoming an adult and pretending I have my life under control. I landed what I thought was going to become my dream job as the manager of the apartment complex we lived at.... too naïve to prepare myself for the nightmare this job would soon become. \n\nNow I am not prejudiced and I never believed in stereotypes but, Oh my sweet baby Jesus, my boss embodied every negative Jewish stereotype one person could possibly contain, here are a few highlights:\n\nHe refused to hire an accountant to handle any financial part of the business so I had to add up every residents individual trash and water bill. And in a minimum of 2 inch heels, personally deliver them to every single one of the 50 apartments in the complex.\n\nCalculate any and all late fees and move-in specials (which was basically one month free rent to move in but the free month was just broken down and added to your monthly rent over your 12 month lease) and run ads with a monthly advertising budget of $50 a month.\n\nFile and attend all court dates for evictions.

Pre-Covid, my boyfriend worked about an hour away from home. I always woke up at 5:30am so I could pack him fresh lunch before he left at 6:10am. I packed for him because he was having some rough time at work and I knew he didn''t get along with a lot of the people there. I did this 6 times a week for a year and a half. Now, near covid, he got promoted and a month-ish after that, work went online so I didn''t have to pack for him.

Recently, I''ve become friends with one of the gals at the office, and we call each other now and then. During our conversation (christmas call) yesterday, I found out something shocking. My boyfriend had been eating work lunch (lunch the job provides) instead of my lunches. I asked her how long he had been eating in the job cafeteria, and she told me from his card logs he''s been eating there, everyday, for a year and a half. She said that the card provided lunch, and when he got lunch, it would notify her machine and there has been notifications everyday for the ENTIRE time I''ve packed for him. (**edit** fyi I didn''t ask for her to snoop on the logs, I didn''t even know she had the logs. It was just a natural flow in the conversation to ask "how long was he doing that?" after she told me "he''s been doing it for a while". when I said "for me" I meant she did it because she was invested in the situ and she said "I looked it up so  you can know, but ..." , not because I told her to)

I got off the call FUMING. I cooked at 5:30am 6 DAYS A WEEK for him and he THREW IT AWAY. Then, my rage turned to humiliation(?) idk, I felt so embarrassed that he hated my food so much that he would eat work lunch instead, now I feel betrayed because he could have been honest, but he wasn''t.

He would always bring his empty lunch bag home and tell me "xyz was pretty good" and stuff like that, but I know he has never eaten my food before. My friend said there was no area to eat aside the cafeteria and that he never brought food there.

I feel like shit, I prided myself in being a good girlfriend and cooking for him but now I know that meant nothing... What do I do?
