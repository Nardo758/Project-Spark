**4. Talk Like A Human**

It’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to impress our audience with fancy words. But Lindsay (and her success) shows us why this is unnecessary (and off-putting).

Check out this excerpt from her recipe for lentil soup as an example:

*"I see you, hungry reader whose life is crazy right now, who has a hard time finding the time to cook even though you love food, who opens the fridge to grab a quick lunch to take to work in the morning rush only to find NOTHING that seems good enough, who values the big bowl of comfort food pasta above all else, who is not asking for much other than GOOD FOOD that is made for REAL LIFE."*

It’s almost as if she’s joking around with us through the screen.

It puts us at ease and lets us know this isn’t going to be a dry lecture.

It also lets us know there’s a human being behind the content and not an AI chatbot.

💡 *Content Psychology Tip*: We are more likely to engage with people who we like and can relate to. While this seems obvious in real life, creators often ignore it in their content \~ The Liking Principle.

**5. Make It Easy For Partners**

Sponsors and partners don’t really care about the backstory.

They care whether your audience is aligned with theirs and whether you can drive results.

On the Pinch Of Yum “Sponsored Content” contact page you have:

\- A very **brief** backstory

\- Different types of sponsored content they can produce

\- Brands they’ve worked with before

\- Previous case studies (including the number of clicks/views they’ve driven to brands before)

\- A contact form to find out more

\- Precise numbers, evidence of past results, and a call to action.

💡 *Content Psychology Tip*: We see things as more credible when they’re expressed in precise figures. When you want your audience/partners to trust you, be precise and not wishy-washy in your content \~ Quantification Bias

**6. Teach The Craft Behind The Craft**

Pinch Of Yum has a thriving membership program.

But it isn’t a cooking program.

“Food Blogger Pro” teaches people how to become food creators themselves.
