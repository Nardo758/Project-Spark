As such: I''m going **all out on a completely black/sleek/minimalist looking gaming build.** I want to future proof this thing as much as possible. As some examples, please **do not** recommend a 4th Gen SSD, I want 5th gen to future proof, and please do not recommend a monitor with 1.4 DVI, I want 2.1 to future proof, etc.

With a budget of **around 10,000** CANADIAN (can go **lower or higher** than this range, but only if **ZERO** **performance or looks** will be compromised), can someone please build me the **highest possible end 4K all maxed settings gaming machine for 2025?** I also use some architectural and civil engineering programs, so I''d prefer the 9950 3DX processor instead of the 9800 CPU, even if there''s like a .00001% hit to gaming performance (I''ve heard they''re almost identical for gaming, but the 9950 is better for other non gaming things as well).

I want a **minimalist, sleek, modern, all Black Look (Non RGB if possible - but if needs to have some RGB for better performance, that''s fine).**

**Prefer 64 - 96 GB RAM because of my engineering programs (this build will still just be 90% gaming, and 10% work, only as a fall back if I have to work from home, so focus on gaming, plus I want to future proof).**
