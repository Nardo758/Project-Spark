Since November 2023, I have also been taking **Fycompa 2 mg** **(only!)** per day. It works well for my seizures – they have reduced by about half and are less intense, which means fewer bruises and less tongue biting. I really appreciate this effect.

Fycompa seems to have intensified gradually. My personality has become very **dark, tense, and even more negative**. I often feel short of breath and find myself constantly thinking about the worst possible outcomes.

On good days I can function, but **even small triggers can make me extremely angry. Minor frustrations can send me straight to thoughts like “it’s time to die”.** My husband was so frustrated that he has an affair - because I have been blaming him too much every single day. 

I have tried 2-3 suicide methods (hanging and plastic bag suffocation), and keep Googling/ChatGPT on similar topics.

My psychiatrist has discouraged the use of mood stabilizers because he is worried that I might overdose on them.

Eventually, and very sadly, I talked with my neurologist today, and we agreed to stop Fycompa.

I also want to quit my job now..as a new start after taking off Fycompa.
