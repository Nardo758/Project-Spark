>>I know, my anger isn''t from not liking my lunches, which you know, he can totally just tell me, but from NOT telling me anything. I''m wondering if there''s something wrong with me which made him not want to tell me.

>>>She could be fired for that. Also did he ever ask you to make his lunch for him every day or did you just do it? It seems like he was afraid to tell you the truth about a fairly simple thing and based on your reaction I’m understanding that a bit. Even though he is 3 years older than you and should’ve been mature about confronting you, if he never even asked you to do it to begin with I could see what that’s a little awkward. Also that you’re so close to his colleagues that you’re video chatting is a bit more than I’d be comfortable with but that’s just me.

I feel humiliated, embarrassed and slightly upset. What do about that?**\n\n**Originally posted to r/relationship_advice**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/V214fzXnPI)  **Dec 26, 2021**\n\nPre-Covid, my boyfriend worked about an hour away from home. I always woke up at 5:30am so I could pack him fresh lunch before he left at 6:10am. I packed for him because he was having some rough time at work and I knew he didn''t get along with a lot of the people there. I did this 6 times a week for a year and a half. Now, near covid, he got promoted and a month-ish after that, work went online so I didn''t have to pack for him.\n\nRecently, I''ve become friends with one of the gals at the office, and we call each other now and then. During our conversation (christmas call) yesterday, I found out something shocking. My boyfriend had been eating work lunch (lunch the job provides) instead of my lunches. I asked her how long he had been eating in the job cafeteria, and she told me from his card logs he''s been eating there, everyday, for a year and a half. She said that the card provided lunch, and when he got lunch, it would notify her machine and there has been notifications everyday for the ENTIRE time I''ve packed for him. (**edit** fyi I didn''t ask for her to snoop on the logs, I didn''t even know she had the logs. It was just a natural flow in the conversation to ask \"how long was he doing that?\" after she told me \"he''s been doing it for a while\". when I said \"for me\" I meant she did it because she was invested in the situ and she said \"I looked it up so  you can know, but ...\" , not because I told her to)\n\nI got off the call FUMING. I cooked at 5:30am 6 DAYS A WEEK for him and he THREW IT AWAY. Then, my rage turned to humiliation(?) idk, I felt so embarrassed that he hated my food so much that he would eat work lunch instead, now I feel betrayed because he could have been honest, but he wasn''t.\n\nHe would always bring his empty lunch bag home and tell me \"xyz was pretty good\" and stuff like that, but I know he has never eaten my food before. My friend said there was no area to eat aside the cafeteria and that he never brought food there.\n\nI feel like shit, I prided myself in being a good girlfriend and cooking for him but now I know that meant nothing... What do I do?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**N0_ah_47**\n\n>Wtf? So he couldn''t tell you he doesn''t want your lunch? Dafuq is wrong with him.

It doesn''t matter if you are couchsurfing homeless, car camping homeless, sleeping at your office homeless, on the street homeless, hunkered down in a tent in the woods homeless, crashing in the laundry room of an apartment building in Downtown Rochester at night homeless,  or living in a shelter homeless...

It all sucks!  Especially in the winter, and one of the things that sucks the most about it is that this state intentionally created the most inefficient waste of time method to determine how many homeless there are. 

The annual point in time homeless census is held in the middle of January. And you only get counted if you happen to interact with a police officer or case manager etc etc within that specific 24-hour period. AND the state keeps the damn date secret - like top secret - and make it nearly impossible for a person who is homeless to even know that they''re supposed to go get counted.

Not surprisingly, for decades this method of counting the homeless has resulted in amazingly low numbers! 

And would the State of New Hampshire perhaps borrow something from the Bible that the Republicans claim to love so much and have everyone be publicly and repeatedly informed of when the census is and how to do it? Even if they did, it would still be difficult for the people who are homeless to be counted as being homeless.

There is so much stigma that California had to invent a whole new word called "unhoused" in their attempt to at least make it a little less awful to have that particular part of your life on a government form. 

If your boss, your coworkers, your classmates, your "neighbors", or the random Karens in your town find out that you do not actually have a signed lease, rental agreement, or deed with your name on it then all the s*** hits the fan and you become persona non grata in the community ..
 and increasingly barred in the voting booth.
