I''d spend hours hunting through comment sections looking for those golden nuggets where people express real pain points. You know the ones - "I would pay for...", "Why doesn''t anyone make...", "This drives me crazy..."

**The problem:** Manual research is soul-crushing and you miss 90% of the good stuff.

**What I found:** The best startup ideas aren''t in the original posts - they''re buried in the comments where people are actually venting about their problems.

So I built something to automate this whole process.

**Here''s what actually worked:**

• **YouTube comment analysis** \- People are brutally honest in YT comments about what frustrates them • **AI categorization** \- Automatically groups similar pain points so you see patterns • **Niche targeting** \- Input any industry and find recurring problems people are willing to pay to solve • **Real validation** \- These aren''t hypothetical problems, they''re real people expressing real frustration

**Early results so far:**

* Found 3 validated SaaS ideas in my first week
* One idea already has 50+ people saying "I''d pay for this" in the comments
* Saved probably 40+ hours of manual research

The craziest part? I''m seeing pain points I never would have found manually. The AI catches subtle patterns across thousands of comments that I''d never spot.

**What I learned:** The best opportunities aren''t obvious. They''re in the noise that most founders never bother to analyze systematically.

Still early days, but this approach is already changing how I think about idea validation. Instead of guessing what people want, I''m literally watching them ask for it.

Anyone else tired of playing startup idea roulette? Would love to hear what''s worked for your research process.

Lately I''ve been having an ultimate struggle, my in-game performance has dropped DRASTICALLY.  
I am currently an MGE, but with my performance my past few days I might as well be considered below Silver 1.  
  

**My last Faceit match (vs level 3-4) on Overpass, I had a whopping 1 kill and 26 deaths.**
  
My last MM Comp I had 10 kills and 27 deaths. (Enemy team was MG1 - MGE) 
  
People just seem impossible to kill for me, but for everyone else it''s like its the easiest thing on the planet.  
  
Another thing I''m noticing is that I''m becoming much more angry with the game.  I won''t be toxic and yell at my teammates, but I get just mad at the game.  I don''t know how to counteract this either, but I''ve just been 10x more stressed in each game than usual.  
  
I need some advice or help from you guys who are more experienced, how do you deal with problems like this if you have them?
