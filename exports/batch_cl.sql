- Waited tables all 4 years 
- Coached my sorority dance team for a Greek-life dance contest to raise money for breast cancer awareness 


Postgrad work experience: 

- Have been at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard for over 2 years as a research associate (promoted to RAII recently), will be 3 years during app cycle. The lab is mainly biomedical and neurodegeneration focused. 
- Will hopefully have two or three second author publications (one is in final stages of publication, one is a manuscript and one is pending a patent) and two first author publications by the time of the application cycle (both pending final data collection for manuscript completion). 
- I’ve presented one of my first author publications (an engineered mouse model made for a specific gene targeting therapeutic efficacy study) at two conferences 
- Will present my other first author pub as a poster at another conference this summer 

Post grad volunteer experience: 
- I still volunteer for the Stem Cell registry as an advocate to break down policy barriers for patients seeking cellular treatment and for donor protection 
- every spring I do “Broad Scientists in the Classroom” where I come up with and teach three lectures/learning activities for two 8th grade classrooms on natural selection, mutations and the central dogma of biology. 
- I spent 8 weeks nature journaling with a fourth grade classroom with my local community volunteering group 
- I wouldn’t consider this volunteering but I regularly coordinate inter-faith and inter-cultural community gatherings in my city to foster community connection
