# What PolyPod does:

* Tracks *real* time spent listening (e.g. listening to a 30min podcast at 2× speed = 15 minutes logged).
* Lets you set daily listening goals and sends reminders.
* Keeps track of streaks to keep you motivated.
* Lets you search / discover from over 4million podcasts which you can then subscribe to
* Allows you to tag podcasts by language and credit listening time toward that language.
* Provides statistics, listening history, and daily summaries
* A built-in player with background listening, time tracking, and a sleep/playback timer

Currently there is only an iOS version, but its built in such a way that Android is possible to build (i dont have access to Android devices, so concentrated on iOS to begin with).

Looking for any feedback people have, is it useful? anything you would add / change?

If anyone wants to know the tech stack is:

* Supabase - auth and backend postgres database
* PowerSync - for cloud sync
* Expo - for builds, submissions, router, image and a few other bits
* Revenue Cat - for in app subscription handling
* Tanstack Query - use this a lot in the web and i like using it
* Taddy - for podcast API
* Drizzle - for database ORM
* Zustand - for local state management
* Nativewind - for styling
* React-Native-Track-Player - Audio playback and management

I would fully recommend react-native as a tech stack, its been really easy to develop the app and use my previous react knowledge and libraries.

As a developer one area that i struggle most in is where and how to get visibility to of my app so people know it exists? How do people tackle this problem?
