# Introduction: When Hardware Mimics the Brain

Imagine a computer chip that thinks like a brain — processing information through millions of interconnected "neurons," learning from experience without explicit programming, consuming a tiny fraction of the power needed by traditional computers, and responding to events in real-time rather than waiting for clock cycles.

This isn''t science fiction. It''s neuromorphic engineering — a revolutionary field that builds hardware and software inspired by biological nervous systems.

Neuromorphic computing is a computing approach inspired by the human brain''s structure and function. It uses artificial neurons to perform computations, mimicking neural systems for tasks such as perception, motor control, and multisensory integration.
