The analysis is *what* was going to be achieved by it, *why* are countries allowing it. No analyst, expert got it. "Experts" never teach *why* & just repeat headlines in own language. There''s never any outcome in their talks, no predictions, no quantification of *what* will happen, *how* it will happen, *when* it will happen. Just English literature which sounds cool/different & hence it becomes analysis.

  
  
In a de-dollarized world you will have to **by-pass the existing payment systems & gateways**. That''s a basic condition, therefore all players working in that scheme **(including the US)** will move away from the prevalent system - **SWIFT.**  
  


  
Since in a **multilateral world order, multiple currencies will be tradeable & not just one ($)**, therefore you see Russia, China, India, all building their own gateways & apps for their citizens locally.  
  


  
Once these platforms gain acceptance locally, people get used to using them, then begins foreign journey. Acceptance at countries beyond borders for remittances, exchange, payments, etc.  
  


  
Then comes the critical part - linking of these various flavours, thus enabling cross-country trade bypassing the $, & more importantly - SWIFT.  
  


  
**Why bypassing it is important for dedollarization?**

  
When you exchange messages on Facebook or WhatsApp can US read your messages? You are living in a very media-infested world if you have reasons to believe otherwise. Even the keystroke you make on your mobile keyboard is foreign owned. A software sitting on your mobile, which you willingly downloaded becayit gives you cool features for free. How naive.

  
On SWIFT, where two countries commence a deal say, India buying a kg of cotton from China for $x. Their network, which reads the value, deducts from sender & credits it to the receiver, both identities known, their respective details known, the quantity traded, & lastly the price. Imagine the power such information when possessed. Every trade happening across the globe through the SWIFT is therefore known.

  
Ever wondered, why our IT captains of the industry did not build a decent social media app, or messaging service ever? Was it incompetence or compulsion?  
  
People have no idea how difficult & brave step it was to build UPI. And so goes the same for similar apps in other countries, why they all came up in same timeframes by exactly those countries whose intent was aligned to end $ hegemony.

  
  
All this was thought of in 2022 & that post was written. People laugh & mock because unless they get a Google search result or media link, they don''t believe anything. If their name didn''t come up in search results they would doubt their own existence. Such is the brain-dead dependency of *"intelligent folks"*.

 

With time, everything appears. Such people still say Demonetization was a failure. **The single biggest atom bomb that destroyed economy of at least 2 nations in our neighborhood whose seeds were sown in 2015 BRICS.** But you will hear it was a sudden decision, no one was consulted, etc. It doesn''t happen like that. But till the **final goal isn''t achieved such things cannot & should not be put in public.**  
  
Now that you understood UPI, now connect ***why Qatar.***
