### Replacement of Pandoc - Native Performance

Kreuzberg v3 relied on **Pandoc** - an amazing tool, but one that had to be invoked via subprocess because of its GPL license. This had significant impacts:

**v3 Pandoc limitations:**
- System dependency (installation required)
- Subprocess overhead on every document
- No streaming support
- Limited metadata extraction
- ~500MB+ installation footprint

**v4 native parsers:**
- **Zero external dependencies** - everything is native Rust
- Direct parsing with full control over extraction
- **Substantially more metadata** extracted (e.g., DOCX document properties, section structure, style information)
- **Streaming support** for massive files (tested on multi-GB XML documents with stable memory)
- Example: PPTX extractor is now a **fully streaming parser** capable of handling gigabyte-scale presentations with constant memory usage and high throughput

### New File Format Support

v4 expanded format support from ~20 to **56+ file formats**, including:

**Added legacy format support:**
- `.doc` (Word 97-2003)
- `.ppt` (PowerPoint 97-2003)
- `.xls` (Excel 97-2003)
- `.eml` (Email messages)
- `.msg` (Outlook messages)

**Added academic/technical formats:**
- LaTeX (`.tex`)
- BibTeX (`.bib`)
- Typst (`.typ`)
- JATS XML (scientific articles)
- DocBook XML

We will release v4.0.0 at the beginning of next year - in just a couple of weeks time. For now, v4.0.0-rc.8 has been released to all channels.\n\n## What is Kreuzberg?\n\nKreuzberg is a document intelligence toolkit for extracting text, metadata, tables, images, and structured data from 56+ file formats. It was originally written in Python (v1-v3), where it demonstrated strong performance characteristics compared to alternatives in the ecosystem.\n\n## What''s new in V4?\n\n### A Complete Rust Rewrite with Polyglot Bindings\n\nThe new version of Kreuzberg represents a massive architectural evolution. **Kreuzberg has been completely rewritten in Rust** - leveraging Rust''s memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and native performance. The new architecture consists of a high-performance Rust core with native bindings to multiple languages. That''s right - it''s no longer just a Python library.\n\n**Kreuzberg v4 is now available for 7 languages across 8 runtime bindings:**\n\n- **Rust** (native library)\n- **Python** (PyO3 native bindings)\n- **TypeScript** - Node.js (NAPI-RS native bindings) + Deno/Browser/Edge (WASM)\n- **Ruby** (Magnus FFI)\n- **Java 25+** (Panama Foreign Function & Memory API)\n- **C#** (P/Invoke)\n- **Go** (cgo bindings)\n\n**Post v4.0.0 roadmap includes:**\n\n- PHP\n- Elixir (via Rustler - with Erlang and Gleam interop)\n\nAdditionally, it''s available as a **CLI** (installable via `cargo` or `homebrew`), **HTTP REST API server**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for Claude Desktop/Continue.dev, and as **public Docker images**.\n\n### Why the Rust Rewrite? Performance and Architecture\n\nThe Rust rewrite wasn''t just about performance - though that''s a major benefit. It was an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the architecture:\n\n**Architectural improvements:**\n- **Zero-copy operations** via Rust''s ownership model\n- **True async concurrency** with Tokio runtime (no GIL limitations)\n- **Streaming parsers** for constant memory usage on multi-GB files\n- **SIMD-accelerated text processing** for token reduction and string operations\n- **Memory-safe FFI boundaries** for all language bindings\n- **Plugin system** with trait-based extensibility\n\n### v3 vs v4: What Changed?\n\n| Aspect | v3 (Python) | v4 (Rust Core) |\n|--------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Core Language** | Pure Python | Rust 2024 edition |\n| **File Formats** | 30-40+ (via Pandoc) | **56+ (native parsers)** |\n| **Language Support** | Python only | **7 languages** (Rust/Python/TS/Ruby/Java/Go/C#) |\n| **Dependencies** | Requires Pandoc (system binary) | **Zero system dependencies** (all native) |\n| **Embeddings** | Not supported | ✓ FastEmbed with ONNX (3 presets + custom) |\n| **Semantic Chunking** | Via semantic-text-splitter library | ✓ Built-in (text + markdown-aware) |\n| **Token Reduction** | Built-in (TF-IDF based) | ✓ Enhanced with 3 modes |\n| **Language Detection** | Optional (fast-langdetect) | ✓ Built-in (68 languages) |\n| **Keyword Extraction** | Optional (KeyBERT) | ✓ Built-in (YAKE + RAKE algorithms) |\n| **OCR Backends** | Tesseract/EasyOCR/PaddleOCR | **Same + better integration** |\n| **Plugin System** | Limited extractor registry | **Full trait-based** (4 plugin types) |\n| **Page Tracking** | Character-based indices | **Byte-based with O(1) lookup** |\n| **Servers** | REST API (Litestar) | **HTTP (Axum) + MCP + MCP-SSE** |\n| **Installation Size** | ~100MB base | **16-31 MB complete** |\n| **Memory Model** | Python heap management | **RAII with streaming** |\n| **Concurrency** | asyncio (GIL-limited) | **Tokio work-stealing** |\n\n### Replacement of Pandoc - Native Performance\n\nKreuzberg v3 relied on **Pandoc** - an amazing tool, but one that had to be invoked via subprocess because of its GPL license.

Organizations face a choice between accepting vendor lock-in with suboptimal domain management tools or fragmenting their infrastructure across multiple providers, neither of which represents an optimal solution.

The underlying problem reflects broader architectural deficiencies in how cloud providers handle domain lifecycle management, DNS propagation, and inter-system reconciliation.
