She would have time to admire the building later. First, she needed to get inside and start her new job. Once she was in the lobby, she couldn’t help but eavesdrop on the chatter among the other reporters, as they made their way to the elevator.

“–rise in missing teens in Hob’s Bay,” one of them was saying.

“Can I help you?” a woman asked from the information desk. She stared down Lois as if she didn’t belong.

Lois lifted her shoulders and approached, putting on her best smile. “I’m Lois Lane,” she said. “I’m here to meet Perry White.”

“Perry White?” the attendant asked. “You know he’s the Editor-In-Chief, right? He doesn’t have time to give tours to school children.”

Where could he be?\n\n“Still no answer?” said Chloe in a small window on Lois’ laptop screen.\n\n“I can go look for him,” Kara offered from the couch, scrolling through her phone. She was there to keep an eye on Lois and the kids, in case they were targeted next, but she wanted to help.\n\nThere hadn’t been any reported sightings of Superman in action since he went to look for more clues. Lois had to get a hold of him. She had discovered the mastermind behind the robotic attacks and kidnappings of their friends and colleagues was Dabney Donovan, Co-Founder of Cadmus Labs. And the target of Lois’s first front-page story ever.\n\nWay before Cadmus was publicly known, Donovan did his own scientific research. Filled with its own ethical violations. Perhaps that’s why he carried out those studies on his own? Cadmus had its own questionable practices, but what Donovan did was next level.\n\nShe still wasn’t quite sure how Eddie fit into it. Sure, she knew him socially, but he felt like an outlier in the grand scheme.\n\nLois ended the attempted call to her husband and shook her head. “It’s okay, Kara,” Lois answered. “I’ll catch Clark up when he gets back. For now, we have to find Donovan.”\n\nChloe typed away on her end. “I’ll look up any possible connections to that company he ran back in the day. What was it called again?”\n\n“Eidolon,” Lois answered softly as she drifted toward the window.\n\n“Of course,” Chloe chuckled. “They always go for the Greek mythology.”\n\nIt seemed like so long ago, but it was still fresh in Lois’s mind. Working for the Daily Planet as a teenager was an exciting time. She made new friends, uncovered nefarious activities, and cemented her legacy at the esteemed newspaper, quickly becoming a rising star.\n\n“You still with me?” Chloe asked, interrupting her reminiscing.\n\nLois turned back to her laptop. “Yeah,” she said. “Just thinking back.”\n\n---\n\n**Daily Planet**\n\n*Years Ago*\n\n---\n\nAfter moving around from army base to army base, Lois and her family were finally settling down in Metropolis. It was a relief to stay in one place finally, but so far she had found it hard to make friends at school. And some sleuthing around the faculty got her into trouble with the principal. Her dad, The General, wasn’t happy about that.\n\nBut her “extracurricular” activities eventually reached Perry White, the Daily Planet''s Editor-in-Chief. He was looking for students to join an experimental program in which teens would investigate and report stories with their own special column in the paper. Principal Butler had his flaws, but Lois couldn’t dislike him *too* much after she was the first name he recommended to Perry.\n\nConvincing the General to let her join after her troubles at school was a challenge, but she managed to convince him it was for the best. Luckily, her mom had her back, too. Well, and her sister Lucy, but it didn’t really matter what she thought.\n\nThe cab slowed as it approached the historic Daily Planet building, and Lois couldn’t help but hold her breath. People shuffled in and out of the glass doors, each with their own determined mission. Her eyes were drawn upward, first to the old school, Art Deco design, which made the building act like a living photograph of the past.\n\nAnd then there was the globe.\n\nThe giant, golden sphere had the letters “Daily Planet” circling its center, as if in orbit. It was wondrous and magical. Its almost futuristic feel, in sharp contrast to the antiquity of the rest of the building, seemed like a promise that it would always be there.\n\nAfter paying for her ride and exiting the vehicle, she slowly approached the revolving door, admiring the distinguished wear of the golden metal.\n\n“In or out?” a man asked before rushing past her.\n\nShe would have time to admire the building later. First, she needed to get inside and start her new job.

*If you are here just to answer my question and not argue ignore everything below...*


I know for a fact that most of the replies are going to be "actually I know this short guy..." or something saying these 3 factors are "changeable" (they aren''t). In order to prevent these spam replies and keep it on topic because I know it''s going to happen, I want to discuss all 3 real quick.


***Autism*** - Autism has no cure or any treatment for that matter. The only "treatment" is reducing triggers which will only further social isolation. There is a study which states that people can identify someone with autism in mere seconds. I am bullied and unable to find friends due to this.

***Shortness*** - Past a certain point of shortness, most dating prospects are eliminated. Short men have a 2 fold risk of suicide, earn less money, are less respected, and have less friends. That one short guy you know and are about to comment about is an exception to the rule - and probably has other mitigating factors such as being rich etc. You cannot "fix" shortness- leg lengthening surgery is inaccessible in most places, very expensive, and there is a good chance you will lose the ability to walk.

***Ugly*** - *"BUT beauty is subjective !!"*. For an individual, yes. However, if you sample a large amount of people, you will find that many traits are desirable and many are undesirable across all cultures (there are once again studies on this).  If it was subjective and humans did not have a preprogrammed sense of beauty, you would expect the distribution of trait preferences to be random (its not). As a result of this thought experiment - beauty is entirely objective. You could get nosejobs and stuff, but in my case, my entire bone structure on my face is screwed. I cannot cure my ugliness. If there was some magical operation, it would also be absurdly expensive.
