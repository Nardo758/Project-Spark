You can''t get a real ID to be able to vote if you don''t have any way to prove where you live. The inability of the many legally  homeless people to be able to prove they were actually here in New Hampshire got to be such a problem that the Department of Health and Human Services in New Hampshire had to make up a "roommate agreement" form that gives you absolutely NO rights as a tenant just to make some semblance of an attempt to register a person as a New Hampshire resident. 

Problem is that quite often the first thing people who are homeless or legally homeless discover is it they have no where to receive their freaking mail, which is why all sorts of nonprofits, churches, and day programs try to act as temporary post offices! 

And don''t even get me started on the entire cell phone is a requirement to survive situation! I gave up trying to get people anything like a SafeLink phone just before the pandemic because it had become so freaking complicated that it was often easier just to go panhandle myself with my little Ecumenical Franciscan butt and use the money to buy the person a cheap prepaid. 

I can''t imagine how much more horrific it is now that you can''t just walk into the welfare office in half of the state because they''ve closed a bunch of them, your benefit redetermination is supposed to be done online which entails you staring at a little tiny five inch screen trying to fill out numerous web portal pages, and all the time you''re being told by homeless outreach that you''ve got to be available 24/7 if they do find you a bed somewhere.

There has to be a better way. 

Why can''t we do a huge benefit concert tour around the state and have a crowdfunding thing so all those do-gooders who like to have entertainment while they contribute to the common good can "donate" money so that we can have a 200 bed homeless shelter with a 100 unit tiny house development in every single County across the state? 

Why did it take seven freaking years to get the one low income subsidized apartment building in the entire Strafford County actually approved and built? Why can''t we get subsidized apartments in various sizes so that you know the family with a husband, a wife in a wheelchair, and a elderly aunt can all live in one apartment? 

That one hit really close to home for me because in 2019 the entire stock of section 8 three bedroom wheelchair accessible apartments in the state of New Hampshire was 22 units. The waiting list that I sat on back then was almost 3 and 1/2 years - as a "double priority" domestic violence victim in substandard housing!

They don''t give out estimates anymore on the section 8 wait list because it''s apparently somewhere around 15 years. And you can''t even get into section 8 housing unless you can fill out massive reams of government forms, have some sort of verifiable income, and can convince at least one Community Action Program worker or case', 'Technology & Software', 'NotABlueBird', 2, 0, 0.0, NULL, 'online', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'open', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 'active', '2025-12-15 17:50:24.226892+00:00', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, TRUE, '2025-12-17 00:40:47.476962', 72, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Real-Time Homeless Census & Resource Coordination Platform', 'Current point-in-time homeless census methods are inefficient, conducted only once annually in January, and fail to capture the true scope and dynamic nature of homelessness across various forms (couchsurfing, car camping, shelters, etc.).

Especially in the winter, and one of the things that sucks the most about it is that this state intentionally created the most inefficient waste of time method to determine how many homeless there are. \n\nThe annual point in time homeless census is held in the middle of January. And you only get counted if you happen to interact with a police officer or case manager etc etc within that specific 24-hour period. AND the state keeps the damn date secret - like top secret - and make it nearly impossible for a person who is homeless to even know that they''re supposed to go get counted.\n\nNot surprisingly, for decades this method of counting the homeless has resulted in amazingly low numbers! \n\nAnd would the State of New Hampshire perhaps borrow something from the Bible that the Republicans claim to love so much and have everyone be publicly and repeatedly informed of when the census is and how to do it? Even if they did, it would still be difficult for the people who are homeless to be counted as being homeless.\n\nThere is so much stigma that California had to invent a whole new word called \"unhoused\" in their attempt to at least make it a little less awful to have that particular part of your life on a government form. \n\nIf your boss, your coworkers, your classmates, your \"neighbors\", or the random Karens in your town find out that you do not actually have a signed lease, rental agreement, or deed with your name on it then all the s*** hits the fan and you become persona non grata in the community ..\n and increasingly barred in the voting booth. \n\nYou can''t get a real ID to be able to vote if you don''t have any way to prove where you live.

I booked a trip to Disney and Universal Studios a few months back with just me and my friend and she mentioned her mom would be comfortable finding us a hotel with their family’s time share when it was time for the trip. When the trip came around my friend informed me AT the airport that her mom wanted to take a break from being at home and handling house stuff and was going to stay with us in Orlando but do her own thing.

Her mom tried to apologize for how it felt like this became a family vacation but by the end of the trip I was feeling really uncomfortable and felt like the trip was hijacked in a way. 

Something to note is that this friend I have has this habit of answering calls from her sister all the time while she is hanging out with me or mid conversation with me to go talk to her sister , and she was doing that at the parks so it kind of felt like I was not prioritized at times. 

I feel my friend shouldn’t have let her mom come last minute without telling me ahead ( I would have canceled the trip if I had known ) I’m also annoyed at how she’s constantly calling her sister while we are hanging out and this has been an issue for a long time.
