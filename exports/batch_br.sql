* enjoys **building a roster over seasons**
* likes experimenting with positions and player roles
* actually cares about progression, cap decisions, and long-term team identity
* gets bored playing the same “correct” way every league



…then you’re probably in the wrong leagues.



**miniFL** is an 8-user, adult sim league built around the *team-building loop*.

Light rules. Honor system. Freedom to build your team your way — in exchange for balanced, non-lobby gameplay (no Bunch/Tight spam).



We’re in **Season 5**, and the league has developed real continuity — teams, storylines, and reputations that carry over year to year.



# Quick facts

* PS5 • Madden 26 • Crossplay

* Custom playbooks allowed
* Stock sliders • Practice injuries OFF • Wear & Tear OFF

# Why this league feels different

This Madden cycle is generous with XP/dev — and instead of nerfing it, we lean into it:

* Normal dev picks can become stars quickly
* UDFAs can turn into legit franchise players
* Position changes and experimentation are encouraged
* Cap management and CPU trades still require real thought



You’ll play a lot of CPU — but so does everyone else.

When breakouts and development are on the line league-wide, it stops feeling like filler and starts feeling competitive in a different way.
