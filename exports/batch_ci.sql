**Stuff I''m unsure about:**

* Is 30+ nodes for this normal or am I overengineering?
* Should this be split into multiple workflows? Everything feels so interconnected
* The whole sub-agent communication thing - I''m basically just passing strings back and forth, seems hacky
* Using GPT-4o-mini for classification and GPT-4o for conversations - good call or should I pick one?

I guess it works? Client seems happy. But I look at the workflow canvas and it''s this huge tangled mess and I can''t tell if that''s just how complex workflows look or if I''m doing something wrong.

Anyone built something similar? Would love to know if I''m on the right track or if there''s some obvious thing I''m missing.

Now it''s turned into this monster with 30+ nodes, Redis caching, vector databases, sub-agents talking to each other... and I''m sitting here thinking \"is this how it''s supposed to look or did I fuck something up?\"\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n* FB Messenger webhook triggers everything\n* First it checks Redis (duplicate messages from FB are annoying)\n* Then some intent classifier decides if they want info or booking\n* FAQ agent uses Supabase vector store with RAG\n* Booking agent calls another workflow that checks Booksy calendar\n* Chat memory in Postgres so it remembers context\n\nThe thing that''s bugging me - I built this \"sub-agent\" for checking appointment availability. It takes service name, looks up duration, searches calendar, returns free slots. Works fine but feels... weird? Like am I reinventing the wheel here?\n\nAlso spent 2 days fighting with date parsing in Polish. User says \"w piątek\" and the AI kept booking wrong dates. Had to write a whole essay in the system prompt about counting days correctly from current date. There has to be a better way right?\n\nAnd don''t even get me started on getting GPT to actually CALL the booking function instead of just telling the user \"sure, you''re booked!\" without doing anything.

I’ve been using ChatGPT/Claude a lot for work and personal stuff and I’m drowning.

I have prompts saved in random docs, some in notes apps, a few bookmarked chats. When something works well, I copy it somewhere… and then forget where.

Even worse - the stuff AI makes for me? Blog posts, emails, code snippets, analysis. It’s all over the place. I can never find that one good version from 3 weeks ago.

Curious what others do:

- Where do you save prompts that work well?
- How do you organize the outputs (the stuff AI creates)?
- Do you have any system for improving prompts over time, or is it just trial and error?
- If you work with a team, how do you share what’s working?

I feel like I’m reinventing the wheel every time I start a new chat. There has to be a better way.

What’s your setup?
