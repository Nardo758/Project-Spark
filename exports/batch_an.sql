Apparently he doesn’t understand it, because he keeps doing it.

I don’t want to lose him, because I love him.

But I’m also really tired of this, because I don’t feel like he’s listening to what I’m saying.

And the worst part is almost that HE also talks to other women when we’re out, which is exactly what he says I’m not allowed to do. So why is he allowed to?

I would really like to hear some answers from men - I need to know if I’m the crazy one here.. 

We have been together for 2 years. 


TL;DR version: 

My boyfriend keeps sending me reels about how women shouldn’t have male friends. I already cut off almost all my male friends for him, except one childhood friend. Now he sends aggressive reels about girls who won’t cut off their “best friend,” which gives me anxiety and makes me feel like the bad guy. Meanwhile, he still has a female childhood friend and talks to other women when we’re out — something he says I’m not allowed to do. I love him, but I’m exhausted and feel like he doesn’t listen.

====================



*I blinked and looked around, confused. My mouth felt strangely hollow and empty. I was in an old wooden house, and I was knelt upon an old kneeler that stung my legs and forced me to straighten my back. The incoherent voice of the man next to me became drowned out by the incessant buzzing of flies. I turned to see him, exhausted, my heart pounding. There, eyes red from sleep deprivation with dark heavy bags beneath them, was a broken man. He wore disgusting white clothes, stained brown and red. His hair was knotted and crusted with dirt, his fingernails long and cracked. His lips were dried and white. His entire figure could have been compared to a sheet of paper—through his thin shirt I could see his entire rib cage, and protruding from his loose pants were his hip bones. His hands were folded hopefully on the top of the kneeler, his eyes gazing up at the hand-made crucifix of the Lord, hung crookedly from a rusted nail.*

*“Oh Lord God,” the man said, his voice hoarse and dried. “Hear my prayer. Save my wife from the plague that has fallen upon her! Remember your promise to us, oh gracious Lord! You promise deliverance, safety, and security in this new land! I have done everything you have asked of me! I have given you what you want! Is my soul not enough? What more could you want, oh gracious God? Please! Hear my cry, and save my wife. May you make her strong again!”*

*That was all the man said, repeatedly, without pause. The longer I stayed next to him, the more my stomach burned. My mind followed. Tempted by the buzzing of the flies around us, I took a look around the room. It was a cabin, one that was divided in half by a wall. Uncleaned cast-iron pans and cooking pots lined with rotting food were piled in a grimy tub. The windows were frosted over from the raging blizzard outside, the log walls creaking as the flames in the lanterns swayed back and forth, pulsating with the draft leaking through the foundation. And then, of course, was that horrible depiction of Christ on the cross. Unlike the art done by professional sculptors and craftsmen, this render of the agonizing scene was a monstrosity. The arms were elongated and stretched far out, farther than they should have been. The legs were perfectly straight, and His back arched forward, as if to cry out in eternal pain. On His mangled head, was a crude recreation of the crown of thrones. The thrones were large, like swords piercing his forehead as He gazed down, not up, at the man and I, those soulless eyes never ceasing their stare.*

*At some point I had begun to drift back asleep, but I was awoken by the strong grip of a man grabbing hold of the back of my neck. His cold hand sent waves of chills rushing down my spine. He grabbed my chin and corked my head to face him, a burning rage blazing in his sunken orbs. “What do you think you’re doing?” he asked, almost shocked by my fatigue. “Do you think you can get rest? That you can sleep? NO! You’re going to kneel with me and you’re going to pray to God that He doesn’t take your mother away, you hear? Do you want her to die? Do you want her to be taken away from us? After all our praying? No! I will not allow her to die! She will live! So, pray with me for once in your miserable life! Pray with me!”*

*“Damn you, Westley, can you just let the Lord take me?” The desperate voice came from the room down the hall, where the flies seemed to be most prominent. It was followed by a series of strangled wheezes and moans of agony, then a silence that was more horrifying than the old man’s response.*

*“You shut your mouth you ungrateful bitch!” he boomed, a coughing fit ensuing. “I am saving your life, and your soul! You wouldn’t still be alive if it weren’t for me! You ought to show me the respect I deserve!” He turned back to me. “And you, you unfaithful Satan-spawn… I will keep you hear until your mother rises from that bed and proclaims the name of Jesus Christ, you hear? You are not going anywhere.”*

 *In an act of desperation, I saw the door directly behind us, jumped to my feet, and began to run. My feet felt like they were shackled to balls of heavy stones, and the more I moved with child-like fever, I felt my consciousness slipping. The old man, screaming my name as he could not physically stand in his condition, ordered me to return to my kneeler, but I did not obey. I threw the door open and rushed outside into the blizzard with only my coat and moccasins. The wind pounded against my pale skin, and soon, I disappeared into the storm, the old man’s cries echoing in the desolate valley. While I walked, I heard the voices of thousands crying out to me in the blizzard, like a horde of souls drifting around in a whirlwind of snow and ice as sharp as blades that cut my ski', 'Technology & Software', 'TalesFromTheCreeps', 1, 1, 0.1, NULL, 'online', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'open', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 'active', '2025-12-14 16:23:52.815855+00:00', '2025-12-15 23:15:51.438053+00:00', 't3_1pm70yf', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pm70yf/the_tragedy_of_willow_wyoming_part_2_onset/', 'reddit', TRUE, '2025-12-17 00:30:02.942573', 72, 'Creative fiction post, not a business opportunity or consumer pain point', '$0', 'n/a', 'low', 'N/A - This is horror fiction content', 1, '["This appears to be creative horror fiction posted to r/TalesFromTheCreeps", "Not a consumer problem or business opportunity", "Katalyst should filter out creative writing/fiction content"]', '[]', '["This is not a business opportunity - it''s a horror story", "Wasting analysis resources on non-business content", "Need better content filtering to distinguish fiction from genuine pain points"]', '["Implement content classification to filter creative fiction", "Focus on subreddits with actual consumer problems (r/mildlyinfuriating, r/assholedesign, etc.)", "Add validation to exclude creative writing subreddits from opportunity analysis"]', 'Content Categorization Quality Control System', 'This horror/creative writing story has been severely miscategorized under ''Technology & Software'' instead of appropriate categories like ''Creative Writing'' or ''Horror Fiction''.
